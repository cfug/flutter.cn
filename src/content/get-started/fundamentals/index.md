这些基础文档仍在持续完善中，我们欢迎你的反馈！
请考虑填写本页底部和本章节各主题页面上列出的调查问卷。

1. [Intro to Dart][] _(Optional)_
    As you might know, Flutter uses the [Dart language][].
    If you have experience with other object-oriented
    languages, like Java, C++, or Swift,
    Dart should feel familiar to you.
    As of this writing,
    [Dart is one of the fastest growing languages][dart-lang],
    in part, thanks to Flutter.
 2. [Widget fundamentals][]
    Learn about one of the primary building blocks
    of a Flutter application, widgets.
 3. [Layout][]
    Flutter is different from other UI frameworks
    in that you create the layout programmatically.
    This allows you to compose widgets,
    Flutter's basic building blocks,
    to realize your own layout vision.
    It also facilitates designing a UI to
    optimize any screen where your app might be used.
 4. [State management][]
    Learn how to share state between widgets and notify other parts of your app
    when the state changes.
    See how to implement MVVM in Flutter to manage state effectively
    for small to medium-sized apps.
 5. [Handling user input][]
    Learn about Flutter's widgets that support
    interactivity, like buttons and text.
    Also, learn how to add interactivity to
    a widget that doesn't already support it.
 6. [Networking and data][]
    Networking is a very large topic,
    so this section focuses on basic networking
    functionality, such as how to retrieve
    or submit data using HTTP,
    how to convert to and from JSON,
    how to use authentication,
    how to implement asynchronicity, and more.
 7. [Local data and caching][]
    Learn about different techniques for caching
    local data.

[Dart 入门][Intro to Dart] _(可选)_
    你可能已经知道，Flutter 使用 [Dart 语言][Dart language]。
    如果你有其他面向对象语言的经验，
    如 Java、C++ 或 Swift，
    Dart 对你来说应该很熟悉。
    截至目前，
    [Dart 是增长最快的编程语言之一][dart-lang]，
    这在一定程度上要归功于 Flutter。
