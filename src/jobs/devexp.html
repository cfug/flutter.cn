title: Flutter and Dart Developer Experience SWE
---

<p>The Flutter team is constantly looking to improve our developer experience story,
and to that end, we are seeking talented software engineers.
We are looking for an engineer to join the Flutter & Dart Developer Experience team -
a vibrant team with years of experience building user-focused developer tooling.
The team has a strong background in IDE development, profiling, static analysis,
and refactoring tools.</p>

<p>In this position, you’ll help develop and maintain tooling to debug and profile
Flutter and Dart applications. You’ll build tools that help users understand their
app’s memory usage, diagnose memory leaks, and you’ll have the opportunity to work
on other tools across our codebase, such as performance and CPU profiling, network
profiling, UI inspection, and app size tools, to name a few. Our tools aim to provide
value to hundreds of thousands of engineers using Dart and Flutter both inside and outside of Google.</p>

<p>You will have the opportunity to develop relationships not only throughout the Dart
and Flutter ecosystem, but also with engineers across Google. Your success in this
space means more productive developers, better products for our users, happier co-workers,
and ultimately more adoption of Dart and Flutter. This project will give you a very
deep understanding of Dart and Flutter.</p>
