## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit,
with shipped support for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS,
and Linux. On Windows, we're allowing Flutter developers to target
an additional 1B users, and we're offering a better alternative to
desktop developers who use Electron, Windows Forms, WPF, or (shudder) UWP!

The Flutter Desktop Team is responsible for the desktop-specific
(Windows, macOS, Linux) embeddings of the Flutter engine,
which includes enabling platform plugins, nesting platform views
inside Flutter apps, and wiring-up accessibility hooks on those
platforms&mdash;and anything else that helps Flutter feel “native” when run in those environments.

## About the position

In the "Windows Engineer" role you'll be part of the team that makes
Flutter apps the absolute best they can be when running on Windows, including:

*   Designing and building multi-window support.
*   Building support for Windows system menu integration.
*   Adding support for shell / window drag and drop.
*   Adding support for nesting Windows UI views inside Flutter apps.
*   Delivering outstanding performance on Windows.
*   Nurturing a thriving community of contributions from open-source
    developers by reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs).

## Our values

### Mentorship

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t
