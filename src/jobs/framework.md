## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit,

all of the user interface components as well as support for layouts,
animations, accessibility, internationalization, touch, mouse, and
keyboard input, and much more. The team is responsible for
everything from sustaining and performance,
to creating new features, and new components.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and
professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here,
