To add iOS as a Flutter app target for macOS, follow this procedure.

This procedure presumes you installed [Xcode][] {{site.appnow.xcode}}

{% include docs/install/compiler/xcode.md target='iOS' devos='macOS' attempt="next" -%}

{% include docs/install/flutter-doctor.md target='iOS' devos='macOS' config='macOSDesktopiOS' %}

[Xcode]: {{site.apple-dev}}/xcode/
