## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit, with shipped support for
iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.  The team is continuously
innovating in the app development space by improving on performance, fidelity,
and developer experience.

The Flutter Ecosystem team is responsible for the quality of the Google-owned
Flutter plugins and for the mechanism by which the Flutter framework
communicates with plugins.  With over 500,000 apps built with Flutter and
thousands of plugins in existence, this team plays a critical role in Flutter’s
success.

## About the position

We are looking for an engineer who is passionate about creating software for
other developers.  A commitment to teamwork, initiative, and strong
communication skills are a must.

As an engineer on the Flutter Ecosystem team, you will:

*   Improve the features, APIs, and implementations of highly ranked Flutter
    plugins such as Maps, WebView, Video Player, Camera, In-App Purchase, and
    Ads.
*   Advance cross-language communication in order to provide a highly optimized
    and developer-friendly pathway between Dart and system-native languages.
*   Nurture a thriving community of contributions from open-source developers by
    reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs).

## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor,
who will help guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships,
and learning the systems you’ll need to do your job.
Your manager can also help you find mentors who can coach you
as you navigate your career at Google. In addition to formal mentors,
we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another,
and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google, we embrace our differences
and are [committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).
In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/),
[Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/)
are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented employees
and their allies with shared values of creating belonging 
across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused
on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead,
we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and
well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.

## Job location

Any Google office location, or fully remote in a timezone 3 hours
behind or ahead of Pacific Standard Time (US West Coast).

## Job responsibilities

*   Sustain and improve the Flutter plugin APIs, documentation, and
    implementation.
*   Work with the platform teams (Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS, and Linux)
    to ensure that Flutter presents a unified set of plugin APIs and a sane
    feature matrix across all platforms.
*   Streamline Flutter’s mechanism for communicating between Dart and
    platform-native languages (e.g. Java, Kotlin, ObjC, Swift, C++).
*   Work with Flutter's open source community by reviewing issues and pull
    requests and by mentoring developers.

## Qualifications

### Minimum qualifications

*   Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent
    practical experience.
