Now that you know how to manage state in your
Flutter app, how can you let users interact
with your app and change its state? 

## Introduction to user input

As a multi-platform UI framework,
there are many different ways for users
to interact with a Flutter app.
The resources in this section introduce
you to some of the common widgets used
for enabling user interaction. 

Some user input types, like [scrolling],
have already been covered in [Layouts][]. 

For an introduction to how you can change app
state in response to user interactions,
check out the following tutorial that
teaches you how to build a "favorite" button:

<i class="material-symbols" aria-hidden="true">flutter_dash</i> Tutorial: [Add interactivity to your Flutter app][]

[Layouts]: /get-started/fwe/layout

## Material 3 demo 

Next, check out the [Material 3 Demo][],
which samples some of the user input widgets
available in the Material 3 component library. 

:::note
This page focuses on Material 3 widgets because
it's the library that many developers start with
when learning Flutter. However,
Flutter also supports [Cupertino][] for iOS-styled widgets,
or you can build your own widget library.

## Get user input

This section covers widgets that help you build
the most common user input methods into your Flutter app. 

### Click or tap (Buttons)

Let a user prompt action in a UI by clicking or tapping. 

The following Material 3 button types are functionally similar,
but are styled differently:

[`ElevatedButton]`[]
: A button with some depth.
  Use elevated buttons to add dimension
  to otherwise mostly flat layouts.

[`FilledButton`][]
: A filled button that should be used for important,
  final actions that complete a flow,
  like **Save**, **Join now**, or **Confirm**.

[`OutlinedButton`][]
: A button with text and a visible border.
  These buttons contain actions that are important,
  but arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.

[`TextButton`][]
: Clickable text, without a border.
  Since text buttons don't have visible borders
  and they must therefore rely on their position
  relative to other content for context.

[`IconButton`][]: A button with an icon. 

[`FloatingActionButton`][]
: A circular icon button that hovers over
  content to promote a primary action.

### Text

Several widgets support text input. 

[`TextField`][]
: Let users enter text, either with hardware
  keyboard or with an onscreen keyboard.

The following series of cookbook articles walk
you through every step on how to build a text field,
retrieve its value, and handle state changes:

[`RichText`][]
: Display text that uses multiple styles.

* Sample code: [Rich Text Editor code][]

[`SelectableText`][]
: Display a string of user-selectable text with a single style.

[`Form`][]
: An optional container for grouping together
  multiple form field widgets.

### Select a value from a group of options

[`SegmentedButton`][]
: Allow users to select from limited set of options.

[`DropdownMenu`][]
: Let users select a choice from a menu and place the
  selected item into the text input field.

[`Slider`][]
: Select from a range of values.

### Toggle values

[`Checkbox`][]
: Select one or more items from a list,
  or toggle an item.

[`CheckboxListTile`][]
: A checkbox with a label.

* Video: [CheckboxListTile (Widget of the Week)][]

[`Switch`][]
: Toggle the on/off state of a single setting.

[`SwitchListTile`][]
: A switch with a label. 

* Video [SwitchListTile (Widget of the Week)][]

[`Radio`][]
: Select between a number of mutually exclusive values.
  When one radio button in a group is selected,
  the other radio buttons in the group cease to be selected.

[`Chip`][]
: Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute,
  text, entity, or action.

### Select a date or time

[`showDatePicker`][]
: Shows a dialog containing a
  [Material Design date picker][].

[`showTimePicker`][]
: Shows a dialog containing a
  [Material Design time picker][].

### Swipe and slide

[`Dismissible`][]
: Clear list items by swiping left or right.

* Video: [Dismissible (Widget of the Week)][]
* Article: [Implement swipe to dismiss][]

[pkg:`flutter_slidable`][]
: A list item with directional slide actions
  that can be dismissed.

## Add interactivity with GestureDetector 

If none of Flutter's widgets fit the functionality
for what you're looking for,
you can add interactivity to your own widget
using `GestureDetector`. 

* Video: [GestureDetector (Widget of the Week)][]
* Documentation: [Taps, drags, and other gestures][]
* Article: [Handle taps][]

Don't forget about accessibility!
If you're building your own custom widget,
you can annotate its meaning with the `Semantics` widget.
It lets you provide descriptions, metadata,
and more to screen readers and other semantic
analysis-based tools. 

* Video: [Semantics (Flutter Widget of the Week)][]

Bonus: For a deeper understanding on how Flutter's
`GestureArena` turns raw user interaction data into
human recognizable concepts like taps, drags, and pinches
check out the following video:

* Video: [GestureArena (Decoding Flutter)][]

## Testing

Once you have finished building user interactions
into your app, don't forget to write tests to
ensure that everything works as expected!

* Article: [Handle scrolling][]

## Next: Networking

This page was an introduction to handling user input.
Now that you know how to accept input from app's users,
you can make your app even more interesting by adding
external data. In the next section,
you'll learn now to fetch data for your app over a network,
how to convert data to and from JSON, authentication,
and other networking features.
