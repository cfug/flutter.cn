**作者: Flutter 团队**

Today marks an important milestone for the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/), as we expand our focus from mobile to incorporate a broader set of devices and form factors. At I/O, we’re releasing our first technical preview of [Flutter for web](https://flutter.dev/web), announcing that Flutter is powering Google’s smart display platform including the Google Home Hub, and delivering our first steps towards supporting desktop-class apps with Chrome OS.

I/O 期间我们迎来 [Flutter 框架](https://flutter.dev/) 的一个重要里程碑，因为我们的开发重点从移动平台扩展到了更广泛的设备和机型。在 I/O 大会上，我们发布了 [Web 版 Flutter 的首个技术预览版](https://flutter.dev/web)，宣布 Flutter 将为包括 Google Home Hub 在内的 Google Smart Display 平台提供技术支持，并迈出利用 Chrome 操作系统支持桌面级应用的第一步。

## From Mobile to Multi-Platform

## 从移动设备到多平台

For a long time, the Flutter team mission has been to build the best framework for developing mobile apps for iOS and Android. We believe that mobile development is ripe for improvement, with developers today forced to choose between building the same app twice for two platforms, or making compromises to use cross-platform frameworks. Flutter hits the sweet spot of enabling a single codebase to deliver beautiful, fast, tailored experiences with high developer productivity for both platforms, and we’ve been excited to see how our early efforts have flourished into one of the [most popular open source projects](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).

长期以来，Flutter 团队的使命一直是为开发 iOS 和 Android 版移动应用构建最佳框架。我们认为对移动开发作出改进的时机已经成熟，因为现在开发者不得不选择在两个平台上构建相同的应用两次，或者作出某些妥协以使用跨平台框架。Flutter 提供了一种最有效的方式，使单个代码库能够为两个平台提供美观、快速和量身定制的体验，并提高开发者的工作效率。我们很高兴能够看到早期的努力成功催生出目前最热门的[开源项目](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)之一。

As we started to home in on [our 1.0 release last year](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/flutter-10-googles-portable-ui-toolkit.html), we began experimenting with broadening the scope of Flutter to other platforms. This was triggered both by internal teams within Google who are increasingly relying on Flutter, as well as the latent potential of the [Dart platform](https://dart.dev) for delivering portable experiences. In particular, a small team who were already building a web framework for Dart for internal usage started an exploratory project (codename “Hummingbird”) to evaluate the technical merits of porting the Flutter engine to support the standards-based web.

从去年开始着力开发 1.0 版本时，我们就开始尝试将 Flutter 的范围扩展到其他平台。这是基于两方面考虑: 一是 Google 内部团队越来越依赖于 Flutter，二是 [Dart 平台](https://dart.dev)有提供便捷式体验的潜力。特别是，已经着手为 Dart 构建 Web 框架以供内部使用的小型团队启动了一个探索性项目 (代号为 "Hummingbird")，以评估移植 Flutter 引擎以支持基于标准的 Web 有何技术优势。

The results of this project were startling, thanks in large part to the rapid progress in web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, which have pervasively delivered hardware-accelerated graphics, animation, and text as well as fast JavaScript execution. Within a few months of beginning the project, we had the core Flutter framework primitives working, and soon after we had demos running on mobile and desktop browsers. Along with Dart’s long pedigree of compiling for the web, this proved that we could also bring the Flutter framework and apps to run on the web.

该项目的成效令人惊叹，这在很大程度上要归功于 Chrome、Firefox 和 Safari 等网络浏览器的快速发展。这些浏览器广泛地提供了硬件加速的图形、动画和文本，以及较快的 JavaScript 执行速度。在项目刚开始的几个月内，我们就成功构建了 Flutter 的核心框架原语。不久之后，我们在移动和桌面浏览器上运行了演示版本。长期以来，Dart 语言经常用于编译网页内容，这证明我们也能在 Web 端运行 Flutter 框架和应用。

In parallel, the core Flutter project has been making progress to enable desktop-class apps, with input paradigms such as keyboard and mouse, window resizing, and tooling for Chrome OS app development. The exploratory work that we did for embedding Flutter into desktop-class apps running on Windows, Mac and Linux has also graduated into the core Flutter engine.

与此同时，Flutter 核心项目不断取得进展，进而推动桌面级应用的发展，其中包括键盘和鼠标等输入工具、窗口大小调整，以及适用于 Chrome 操作系统应用开发的调试工具。针对在 Windows、Mac 和 Linux 上运行的桌面级应用，我们嵌入了 Flutter，而这项探索性工作已逐步演变成 Flutter 的核心引擎。

## A Portable UI Framework for All Screens

## 适用于所有屏幕的便携式界面框架

![Flutter Mobile, Web, Desktop, and Embedded](https://files.flutter-io.cn/posts/flutter-cn/2019/flutter-1dot5-release/flutter-platforms.png){:width="85%"}

It’s worth pausing for a moment to acknowledge the business potential of a high-performance, portable UI framework that can deliver beautiful, tailored experiences to such a broad variety of form factors from a single codebase.

毋庸置疑，高性能的便携式界面框架具有巨大的商业潜力。该框架可以通过单个代码库来为各种设备提供量身定制的出色体验。

For startups, the ability to reach users on mobile, web, or desktop through the same app lets them reach their full audience from day one, rather than having limits due to technical considerations. Especially for larger organizations, the ability to deliver the same experience to all users with one codebase reduces complexity and development cost, and lets them focus on improving the quality of that experience.

对于创业公司来说，这让他们能够通过同一个应用在移动端、Web 端或桌面端接触用户。如此一来，他们从一开始就能全面覆盖所有用户，而不会受到技术上的限制。对于大型组织来说尤其如此，因为他们能够使用同一个代码库为所有用户提供相同的体验，而这会降低工作复杂度和开发成本，更加专注于提升相关体验的质量。

With support for mobile, desktop, and web apps, our mission expands: we want to build **the best framework for developing beautiful experiences for _any_ screen**.

实现对移动、桌面和网络应用的支持后，我们肩负更大的使命: **我们要构建最佳框架，以便为所有屏幕开发出色体验。**

## Flutter for Web

## 适用于 Web 平台的 Flutter

This week, we are releasing the **first technical preview of Flutter for the web**. While this technology is still in development, we are ready for early adopters to try it out and give us feedback. Our initial vision for Flutter on the web is not as a general purpose replacement for the document experiences that HTML is optimized for; instead we intend it as a great way to build highly interactive, graphically rich content, where the benefits of a sophisticated UI framework are keenly felt.

我们即将发布 Web 版 Flutter 的**首个技术预览版**。虽然这项技术还在开发中，但我们准备邀请尝鲜者来试用并提供反馈。对于 Web 版 Flutter，我们的最初设想并不是将其用作文档体验 (针对其优化 HTML ) 的通用替代品；相反，我们打算通过这种有效方式构建高度交互和图形丰富的内容，从而切实感受到成熟界面框架所带来的益处。

To showcase Flutter for the web, we worked with the New York Times to build a demo. In addition to world-class news coverage, the New York Times is famous for its crossword and other puzzle games. Since avid puzzlers want to play on whatever device they’re using at the time, their development team was attracted to Flutter as a potential solution for their needs. Discovering that they could reach the web with the same code was a huge boon. At Google I/O this week, you can get a sneak peek of their [newly refreshed KENKEN puzzle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/prototype/kenken), which runs with the same code on Android, iOS, web, Mac, and Chrome OS.

为了展示 Web 版 Flutter，我们与《纽约时报》合作构建了一个演示版本。《纽约时报》不仅是世界一流的新闻媒体，而且以设计纵横字谜等益智游戏而闻名。由于狂热的解谜玩家希望能在当时使用的任何设备上玩游戏，所以《纽约时报》的开发团队把目光转向 Flutter，将其作为满足读者需求的潜在解决方案。发现能够利用同一组代码访问网页给他们带来了巨大裨益。在 Google I/O 大会上，您可以率先了解他们最近更新的 [KENKEN 解谜游戏](https://www.nytimes.com/games/prototype/kenken)。该游戏利用同一组代码在 Android、iOS、Web、Mac 和 Chrome 操作系统上运行。

![ken-gratulations puzzle](https://files.flutter-io.cn/posts/flutter-cn/2019/flutter-1dot5-release/nyt-game.gif){:width="85%"}

Here’s what Eric von Coelln, Executive Director of Puzzles at the New York Times has to say about their experiences with Flutter:

以下是《纽约时报》解谜游戏执行总监 Eric von Coelln 对 Flutter 使用体验的看法:

> _"The New York Times Crossword has more than 400,000 stand-alone subscriptions and is a daily ritual for puzzle solvers. Along with the Crossword, we’ve grown our portfolio of digital puzzles that reaches more than two million solvers each month._
> 
> _We were already beginning to explore Flutter as a potential solution to the challenge of quickly developing engaging, high-quality mobile experiences. Now the addition of being able to publish to web makes Flutter an even more appealing option to quickly deploy across all of our user platforms. This update of our old Flash-based KenKen game into a multi-platform playable experience is something we’re excited to bring to our solvers this year.”_

> “《纽约时报》纵横字谜游戏的单独订阅数量已超过 40 万份，玩这款游戏已经成为解谜者每天必做的事情。除了纵横字谜游戏，我们还开发了数字解谜游戏，每个月都吸引了超过 200 万名解谜者。 
>
> 我们已经开始探索 Flutter，并将其作为快速开发有趣和优质的移动体验这一挑战的潜在解决方案。现在，我们能够在 Web 端发布游戏，这使 Flutter 成为在所有用户平台快速部署内容的更具吸引力的选择。之前基于 Flash 的 KenKen 游戏经过更新，能够提供多平台的畅玩体验。今年我们很高兴能为解谜者带来全新体验。"

There’s lots more to say about Flutter for web than we have space for here, so check out the dedicated [article about Flutter for web](https://medium.com/flutter-io/bringing-flutter-to-the-web-904de05f0df0) on the Flutter blog.

由于篇幅有限，我们无法在此一一详述 Web 版 Flutter。若有兴趣，请前往 [Flutter 博客](https://medium.com/flutter-io/bringing-flutter-to-the-web-904de05f0df0)，阅读专门介绍 Web 版 Flutter 的文章。

At this early stage, we’re eager to get your feedback on how you’d like to use Flutter for web. We expect to rapidly evolve the code, with a particular focus on performance, and harmonizing the codebase with the rest of the Flutter project.

鉴于目前处于早期开发阶段，我们非常希望收到您的反馈，了解您希望如何使用 Web 版 Flutter。我们希望以性能为重中之重，快速开发代码，并与 Flutter 项目的其他部分协调代码库。

## Flutter for Mobile Devices

## 适用于移动设备的 Flutter

The core Flutter framework also receives an upgrade this week, with the **immediate availability of Flutter 1.5** in our stable channel. [Flutter 1.5](https://medium.com/flutter-io/announcing-flutter-1-5-6e5d7e35b75f) includes hundreds of changes in response to developer feedback, including updates for new App Store iOS SDK requirements, updates to the iOS and Material widgets, engine support for new device types, and Dart 2.3 featuring new [UI-as-code](https://medium.com/dartlang/making-dart-a-better-language-for-ui-f1ccaf9f546c) language features.

我们还会升级核心 Flutter 框架，并会在**稳定版 channel 立即提供 Flutter 1.5**。根据开发者的反馈，我们对 [Flutter 1.5](https://medium.com/flutter-io/announcing-flutter-1-5-6e5d7e35b75f) 进行了数百处更改，包括对全新应用商店 iOS SDK 要求、iOS 和材料微件的更新，新增对新设备类型的引擎支持，以及对具有最新 [UI-as-code](https://medium.com/dartlang/making-dart-a-better-language-for-ui-f1ccaf9f546c) 语言特征的 Dart 2.3 作出改进。 

As the framework itself matures, we’re investing in building out the supporting ecosystem. The architectural model of Flutter has always prioritized a small core framework, supplemented by a rich package community. In the last few months, Google has contributed production-quality packages for web views, Google Maps, and Firebase ML Vision, and this week, we’re adding [initial support for in-app payments](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/in_app_purchase). And with over 2,000 open source packages available for Flutter, there are options available for most scenarios.

随着框架本身逐渐成熟，我们正在设法构建支持生态系统。Flutter 的架构模型一贯优先考虑小型核心框架，并辅以丰富的软件包社区。在过去的几个月，Google 为网页视图、Google 地图和 Firebase ML Vision 提供了产品级质量的软件包。我们还将新增对 [应用内支付](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/in_app_purchase) 的初步支持。得益于 2,000 多个适用于 Flutter 的开放源代码软件包，大多数场景均有合适的选择。 

One particularly exciting project that we’re announcing this week at I/O is the [ML Kit Custom Image Classifier](http://github.com/firebase/mlkit-custom-image-classifier). Built using Flutter and Firebase, it offers an easy-to-use app-based workflow for creating custom image classification models. You can collect training data using the phone's camera, invite others to contribute to your datasets, trigger model training, and use trained models, all from the same app.

在今年的 I/O 上，我们宣布推出一个尤其令人振奋的项目，即 [ML Kit 自定义图像分类器](http://github.com/firebase/mlkit-custom-image-classifier)。该工具利用 Flutter 和 Firebase 构建，可为创建自定义图像分类模型提供基于应用的简易工作流。您可以使用手机的摄像头收集训练数据、邀请他人为您的数据集贡献素材、触发模型训练以及使用训练过的模型，这些操作都可以在同一个应用中实现。

Flutter continues to grow in popularity and adoption. A [growing roster of demanding customers](https://flutter.dev/showcase) including eBay, Sonos, Square, Capital One, Alibaba and Tencent are developing apps with Flutter. And they’re having fun! Here’s what Larry McKenzie, a senior developer at eBay had to say about Flutter:

Flutter 越来越受欢迎，使用人数也越来越多。[有需求的客户](https://flutter.dev/showcase)不断增加，其中包括 eBay、Sonos、Square、Capital One、Alibaba 和 Tencent。这些公司正在利用 Flutter 开发应用，并从中发现乐趣！以下是 eBay 的高级开发者 Larry McKenzie 对 Flutter 的看法:

> _“Flutter is fast! Features that once took us multiple days to implement can be finished in a single day. Many problems we used to spend a lot of time on, simply no longer occur. Our team can now focus on creating more polished user experiences and delivering functionality. Flutter is enabling us to exceed expectations!”_

>_“Flutter 运行速度很快！过去需要很多天才能实现的功能，现在只需一天就能完成。过去我们花费很多时间处理的问题，如今再也不会发生了。我们的团队现在可以专注于创建更出色的用户体验和提供相关功能。Flutter 让我们能够超越期望！”_

More broadly, [LinkedIn recently conducted a study](https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/tech-tips/the-fastest-growing-skills-among-software-engineers--and-how-to-) that showed **Flutter is the single fastest-growing skill among software engineers**, based on site members claiming it on their profile over the last 12 months. And in the recent 2019 StackOverflow developer survey, [Flutter was listed as one of the most-loved developer frameworks](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools).

从更广泛的角度上看，LinkedIn 最近进行的一项研究显示，根据网站成员在过去一年中所添加的个人资料，Flutter 是软件工程师中[增长最快的一项技能](https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/tech-tips/the-fastest-growing-skills-among-software-engineers--and-how-to-)。在最近的 2019 年 StackOverflow 开发者调查问卷中，Flutter 被列为 [最受欢迎的开发者框架之一](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools)。

## Flutter for Desktop

## 适用于桌面平台的 Flutter

Flutter is also being used on the desktop. For some months, we’ve been working on the desktop as [an experimental project](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding). But now we’re graduating this into Flutter engine, integrating this work directly into the mainline repo. While these targets are not production-ready yet, we have published early [instructions for developing Flutter apps to run on Mac, Windows, and Linux](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells).

Flutter 目前也被用于桌面平台。在过去几个月，我们一直在研究桌面平台这一 [实验性项目](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding)。但现在该项目逐渐演变成 Flutter 引擎，并将这项工作直接集成到 mainline repo 中。尽管这些目标尚未在生产环境中部署，但我们已发布早期说明，以便开发 [在 Mac、Windows 和 Linux 上运行的 Flutter 应用](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells)。

Another quickly growing Flutter platform is Chrome OS, with millions of Chromebooks being sold every year, particularly in education. Chrome OS is a perfect environment for Flutter, both for running Flutter apps, and as a developer platform, since it supports execution of both Android and Linux apps. With Chrome OS, you can use Visual Studio Code or Android Studio to develop a Flutter app that you can test and run locally on the same device without an emulator. You can also publish Flutter apps for Chrome OS to the Play Store, where millions of others can benefit from your creation.

另一个快速发展的 Flutter 平台是 Chrome 操作系统，每年售出的 Chromebook 多达数百万台，尤其是在教育领域。无论是运行 Flutter 应用，还是作为开发者平台，Chrome 操作系统都为 Flutter 提供了绝佳环境，因为该系统支持执行 Android 和 Linux 应用。借助 Chrome 操作系统，您可以使用 Visual Studio Code 或 Android Studio 来开发 Flutter 应用，并在没有模拟器的情况下使用同一台设备本机测试和运行应用。您还可以在 Play Store 发布适用于 Chrome 操作系统的 Flutter 应用，让数百万用户因您的创作而受益。

## Flutter for Embedded Devices

## 适用于嵌入式设备的 Flutter

As the final example of Flutter’s portability, we offer Flutter embedded on other devices. We recently published [samples](https://medium.com/flutter-io/flutter-on-raspberry-pi-mostly-from-scratch-2824c5e7dcb1) that demonstrate Flutter running directly on smaller-scale devices like Raspberry Pi, and we offer an [embedding API for Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders) that allows it to be used in scenarios including home, automotive and beyond.

举例说明 Flutter 便携性的最后，我们将介绍可嵌入其他设备的 Flutter。最近我们发布了一些示例，演示了直接在 Raspberry Pi 等小型设备上运行 Flutter 的情况。我们还为 Flutter 开发了一个嵌入式 API，以便将其用于家庭和汽车等场景。

Perhaps one of the most pervasive embedded platforms where Flutter is already running is on the smart display operating system that powers the likes of Google Home Hub.

Smart Display 操作系统或许是 Flutter 目前已运行的最常见嵌入式平台之一，其为类似于 Google Home Hub 的设备提供技术支持。

![](https://files.flutter-io.cn/posts/flutter-cn/2019/flutter-1dot5-release/flutter-google-home-hub.png){:width="85%"}

Within Google, some Google-built features for the Smart Display platform are powered by Flutter today. And the Assistant team is excited to continue to expand the portfolio of features built with Flutter for the Smart Display in the coming months; the goal this year is to use Flutter to drive the overall system UI.

目前在 Google 中，Smart Display 平台的部分 Google 自建功能由 Flutter 提供技术支持。Google 助理团队很高兴能够在接下来的几个月继续扩展通过 Flutter 为 Smart Display 构建的各项功能；而今年的目标是利用 Flutter 来驱动整个系统界面。
