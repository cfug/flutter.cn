  This codelab walks you through writing your first Flutter
  app on mobile. You might prefer to try
  [writing your first Flutter app on the web][codelab-web].
  **Note that if you have [enabled web][],
  the completed app just works on all of these devices!**

This is a guide to creating your first Flutter app. If you
are familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming
concepts such as variables, loops, and conditionals,
you can complete this tutorial. You don’t need
previous experience with Dart, mobile, or web programming.

This codelab is part 1 of a two-part codelab.
You can find [part 2][] on [Google Developers Codelabs][]
(as well as a copy of this codelab, [part 1][]).

## What you'll build in part 1
{:.no_toc}

You’ll implement a simple app that generates proposed
names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names,
saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time.
As the user scrolls, more names are generated.
There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

The animated GIF shows how the app works at the completion of part 1.

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What you’ll learn in part 1</h4>

  * How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android,
    and the web
  * Basic structure of a Flutter app
  * Finding and using packages to extend functionality
  * Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle
  * How to implement a stateful widget
  * How to create an infinite, lazily loaded list

  In [part 2][] of this codelab, you'll add interactivity,
  modify the app's theme, and add the ability to navigate
  to a new screen (called a _route_ in Flutter).
{{site.alert.end}}

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What you'll use</h4>

  You need two pieces of software to complete this lab: the
  [Flutter SDK][] and [an editor][].
  This codelab assumes Android Studio,
  but you can use your preferred editor.

  You can run this codelab by using any of the following devices:

  * A physical device ([Android][] or [iOS][]) connected to your
    computer and set to developer mode
  * The [iOS simulator][] (requires installing Xcode tools)
  * The [Android emulator][] (requires setup in Android Studio)
  * A browser (Chrome is required for debugging)
{{site.alert.end}}

If you want to compile your app to run on the web,
you must enable this feature (which is currently in beta).
To enable web support, use the following instructions:

```terminal
$ flutter channel beta
$ flutter upgrade
$ flutter config --enable-web
```

You need only run the config command once.
After you enable web support, every Flutter app you
create also compiles for the web. In your IDE under
the **devices** pulldown, or at the command line
using `flutter devices`, you should now see **Chrome**
and **Web server** listed. The **Chrome** device
automatically starts Chrome. The **Web server**
starts a server that hosts the app so that you can
load it from any browser. Use the Chrome device during
development so that you can use DevTools,
and the web server when you want to test on
other browsers. For more information,
see [Building a web application with Flutter][]
and [Write your first Flutter app on the web][codelab-web].

## Step 1: Create the starter Flutter app

<?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety/step1_base"?>

Create a simple, templated Flutter app, using the instructions in
[Getting Started with your first Flutter app][].
Name the project **startup_namer** (instead of _flutter_app_).

{{site.alert.tip}}
  If you don't see "New Flutter Project" as an option in your IDE,
  make sure you have the [plugins installed for Flutter and Dart][].
{{site.alert.end}}

You'll mostly edit **lib/main.dart**,
where the Dart code lives.

 1. Replace the contents of `lib/main.dart`.<br>
    Delete all of the code from **lib/main.dart**.
    Replace with the following code, which displays
    "Hello World" in the center of the screen.

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart" title?>
    ```dart
    // Copyright 2018 The Flutter team. All rights reserved.
    // Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
    // found in the LICENSE file.

    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    void main() => runApp(MyApp());

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          title: 'Welcome to Flutter',
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(
              title: Text('Welcome to Flutter'),
            ),
            body: Center(
              child: Text('Hello World'),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    {{site.alert.tip}}
      When pasting code into your app, indentation can become skewed.
      You can fix this with the following Flutter tools:

      * Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click the code and
        select **Reformat Code with dartfmt**.
      * VS Code: Right-click and select **Format Document**.
      * Terminal: Run `flutter format <filename>`.
    {{site.alert.end}}

 2. Run the app [in the way your IDE describes][].
    You should see either Android, iOS, or web output,
    depending on your device.

    {% indent %}
      {% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="hello-world.png" alt="Hello world app" %}
    {% endindent %}

    {{site.alert.tip}}
      The first time you run on a physical device,
      it can take awhile to load.
      Afterward, you can use hot reload for quick updates.
      **Save** also performs a hot reload if the app is running.
      When running an app directly from the console using
      `flutter run`, enter `r` to perform hot reload.
    {{site.alert.end}}

### Observations
{:.no_toc}

* This example creates a Material app.
  [Material][] is a visual design language
  that is standard on mobile and the web.
  Flutter offers a rich set of Material widgets.
  It's a good idea to have a `uses-material-design: true` entry
  in the `flutter` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file. 
  This will allow you to use more features of Material,
  such as their set of predefined [Icons][].

* The `main()` method uses arrow (`=>`) notation.
  Use arrow notation for one-line functions or methods.
* The app extends `StatelessWidget`, which makes the app itself a
  widget. In Flutter, almost everything is a widget, including
  alignment, padding, and layout.
* The `Scaffold` widget, from the Material library,
  provides a default app bar, and a body property that
  holds the widget tree for the home screen. The widget subtree
  can be quite complex.
* A widget’s main job is to provide a `build()` method
  that describes how to display the widget in terms of other,
  lower level widgets.
* The body for this example consists of a `Center` widget containing
  a `Text` child widget. The Center widget aligns its widget subtree
  to the center of the screen.

## Step 2: Use an external package

In this step, you’ll start using an open-source package named
[english_words][], which contains a few thousand of the most used
English words plus some utility functions.

You can find the `english_words` package,
as well as many other open source packages, on [pub.dev][].

 1. The `pubspec.yaml` file manages the assets and dependencies
    for a Flutter app. In `pubspec.yaml`, add `english_words`
    (3.1.5 or higher) to the dependencies list:

    <?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety"?>
    <?code-excerpt "{step1_base,step2_use_package}/pubspec.yaml" diff-u="4" from="dependencies" to="english"?>
    ```diff
    --- step1_base/pubspec.yaml
    +++ step2_use_package/pubspec.yaml
    @@ -8,4 +8,5 @@
     dependencies:
       flutter:
         sdk: flutter
       cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
    +  english_words: ^4.0.0-nullsafety
    ```

 2. While viewing the `pubspec.yaml` file in Android Studio's editor view,
    click **Pub get**. This pulls the package into
    your project. You should see the following in the console:

    ```terminal
    $ flutter pub get
    Running "flutter pub get" in startup_namer...
    Process finished with exit code 0
    ```

    Performing `Pub get` also auto-generates the `pubspec.lock`
    file with a list of all packages pulled into the project and
    their version numbers.

 3. In `lib/main.dart`, import the new package:

    <?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety/step2_use_package"?>
    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart" title retain="/^import/" replace="/import.*?english.*/[!$&!]/g" indent-by="2"?>
    ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
      [!import 'package:english_words/english_words.dart';!]
    ```

    As you type, Android Studio gives you suggestions for libraries to import.
    It then renders the import string in gray, letting you know that the
    imported library is unused (so far).

 4. Use the English words package to generate the text instead of
    using the string "Hello World":

    <?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety"?>
    <?code-excerpt "{step1_base,step2_use_package}/lib/main.dart" from="class"?>

    {{site.alert.note}}
      "Pascal case" (also known as "upper camel case"),
      means that each word in the string, including the first one,
      begins with an uppercase letter. So, "uppercamelcase" becomes
      "UpperCamelCase".
    {{site.alert.end}}

 5. If the app is running, [hot reload][]
    to update the running app. Each time you click hot reload,
    or save the project, you should see a different word pair,
    chosen at random, in the running app.
    This is because the word pairing is generated inside the build
    method, which is run each time the `MaterialApp` requires rendering,
    or when toggling the Platform in Flutter Inspector.

### Problems?
{:.no_toc}

If your app is not running correctly, look for typos.
If you want to try some of Flutter's debugging tools,
check out the [DevTools][] suite of debugging and profiling tools.
If needed, use the code at the following links to get back on track.

* [pubspec.yaml]({{code-url}}/startup_namer_null_safety/step2_use_package/pubspec.yaml)
* [lib/main.dart]({{code-url}}/startup_namer_null_safety/step2_use_package/lib/main.dart)

## Step 3: Add a Stateful widget

<?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety/step3_stateful_widget"?>

State<em>less</em> widgets are immutable, meaning that their
properties can’t change&mdash;all values are final.

State<em>ful</em> widgets maintain state that might change
during the lifetime of the widget. Implementing a stateful
widget requires at least two classes: 1) a `StatefulWidget` class
that creates an instance of 2) a `State` class. The `StatefulWidget`
class is, itself, immutable and can be thrown away and regenerated,
but the `State` class persists over the lifetime of the widget.

In this step, you’ll add a stateful widget, `RandomWords`, which creates
its `State` class, `_RandomWordsState`. You'll then use `RandomWords` as
a child inside the existing `MyApp` stateless widget.

<ol markdown="1">
<li markdown="1"> Create the boilerplate code for a stateful widget.<br>
  In `lib/main.dart`, position your cursor after all of the code,
  enter **Return** a couple times to start on a fresh line.
  In your IDE, start typing `stful`.
  The editor asks if you want to create a
  `Stateful` widget. Press **Return** to accept.
  The boilerplate code for two classes appears,
  and the cursor is positioned for you to enter the name of
  your stateful widget.
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Enter `RandomWords` as the name of your widget.<br>
  The `RandomWords` widget does little else beside creating its
  `State` class.<br><br>
  Once you've entered `RandomWords` as the name of
  the stateful widget, the IDE automatically updates
  the accompanying `State` class, naming it `_RandomWordsState`.
  By default, the name of the `State` class is prefixed
  with an underbar. Prefixing an identifier with an
  underscore [enforces privacy][] in the Dart language and
  is a recommended best practice for `State` objects.<br><br>
  The IDE also automatically updates the state class
  to extend `State<RandomWords>`, indicating
  that you're using a generic [`State`][]
  class specialized for use with `RandomWords`.
  Most of the app's logic resides here&mdash;it maintains
  the state for the `RandomWords` widget. This class saves the list
  of generated word pairs, which grows infinitely
  as the user scrolls and, in part 2 of this lab,
  favorites word pairs as the user adds or removes them from
  the list by toggling the heart icon.<br><br>
  Both classes now look as follows:

  ```dart
class RandomWords extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RandomWordsState createState() => _RandomWordsState();
}

class _RandomWordsState extends State<RandomWords> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
  ```
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Update the `build()` method in `_RandomWordsState`:

### Problems?
{:.no_toc}

If your app is not running correctly, look for typos.
If you want to try some of Flutter's debugging tools,
check out the [DevTools][] suite of debugging and profiling tools.
If needed, use the code at the following link to get back on track.

* [lib/main.dart]({{code-url}}/startup_namer_null_safety/step3_stateful_widget/lib/main.dart)

## Step 4: Create an infinite scrolling ListView

<?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety/step4_infinite_list"?>

In this step, you'll expand `_RandomWordsState` to generate
and display a list of word pairings. As the user scrolls the list
(displayed in a `ListView` widget) grows infinitely. `ListView`'s
`builder` factory constructor allows you to build a list view
lazily, on demand.

 1. Add a `_suggestions` list to the `_RandomWordsState`
    class for saving suggested word pairings. Also,
    add a `_biggerFont` variable for making the font size larger.

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart" title region="RWS-var" indent-by="2" replace="/final .*/[!$&!]/g"?>
    ```dart
      class _RandomWordsState extends State<RandomWords> {
        [!final _suggestions = <WordPair>[];!]
        [!final _biggerFont = TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);!]
        // ···
      }
    ```

    Next, you'll add a `_buildSuggestions()` function to the
    `_RandomWordsState` class. This method builds the
    `ListView` that displays the suggested word pairing.

    The `ListView` class provides a builder property, `itemBuilder`,
    that's a factory builder and callback function specified as an
    anonymous function. Two parameters are passed to the
    function&mdash;the `BuildContext`, and the row iterator, `i`.
    The iterator begins at 0 and increments each time the function
    is called. It increments twice for every suggested word pairing:
    once for the ListTile, and once for the Divider.
    This model allows the suggested list to continue growing
    as the user scrolls.

 2. Add a `_buildSuggestions()` function to the `_RandomWordsState` class:

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (_buildSuggestions)" title indent-by="2"?>
    ```dart
      Widget _buildSuggestions() {
        return ListView.builder(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            itemBuilder: /*1*/ (context, i) {
              if (i.isOdd) return Divider(); /*2*/

              final index = i ~/ 2; /*3*/
              if (index >= _suggestions.length) {
                _suggestions.addAll(generateWordPairs().take(10)); /*4*/
              }
              return _buildRow(_suggestions[index]);
            });
      }
    ```

    {:.numbered-code-notes}
     1. The `itemBuilder` callback is called once per suggested word pairing,
        and places each suggestion into a `ListTile` row. For even rows, the
        function adds a `ListTile` row for the word pairing. For odd rows, the
        function adds a `Divider` widget to visually separate the entries. Note
        that the divider might be difficult to see on smaller devices.
     2. Add a one-pixel-high divider widget before each row in the `ListView`.
     3. The expression `i ~/ 2` divides `i` by 2 and returns an integer result.
        For example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 becomes 0, 1, 1, 2, 2. This calculates the
        actual number of word pairings in the `ListView`, minus the divider
        widgets.
     4. If you've reached the end of the available word pairings,
        then generate 10 more and add them to the suggestions list.

    The `_buildSuggestions()` function calls `_buildRow()` once per
    word pair. This function displays each new pair in a `ListTile`,
    which allows you to make the rows more attractive in the next step.

 3. Add a `_buildRow()` function to `_RandomWordsState`:

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (_buildRow)" title indent-by="2"?>
    ```dart
      Widget _buildRow(WordPair pair) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(
            pair.asPascalCase,
            style: _biggerFont,
          ),
        );
      }
    ```

 4. In the `_RandomWordsState` class, update the `build()` method to use
    `_buildSuggestions()`, rather than directly calling the word
    generation library.  ([`Scaffold`][]
    implements the basic Material Design visual layout.)
    Replace the method body with the highlighted code:

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (build)" title region="RWS-build" replace="/(\n  )(return.*|  .*|\);)/$1[!$2!]/g" indent-by="2"?>
    ```dart
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        [!return Scaffold(!]
        [!  appBar: AppBar(!]
        [!    title: Text('Startup Name Generator'),!]
        [!  ),!]
        [!  body: _buildSuggestions(),!]
        [!);!]
      }
    ```

 5. In the `MyApp` class, update the `build()` method by changing the title,
    and changing the home to be a `RandomWords` widget:

    <?code-excerpt path-base="codelabs/startup_namer_null_safety"?>
    <?code-excerpt "{step3_stateful_widget,step4_infinite_list}/lib/main.dart" diff-u="4" from="class MyApp" to="}"?>

    ```

 6. Restart the app. You should see a list of word pairings no matter how far
    you scroll.
