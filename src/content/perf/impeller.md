## What is Impeller?

Impeller provides a new rendering runtime for Flutter.
The Flutter team's believes this solves Flutter's
[early-onset jank][] issue.
Impeller precompiles a [smaller, simpler set of shaders][]
at Engine-build time so they don't compile at runtime.

For a video introduction to Impeller, check out the following
talk from Google I/O 2023.

[Introducing Impellerâ€”Flutter's new rendering engine]({{site.yt.watch}}?v=vd5NqS01rlA)

Impeller has the following objectives:

* **Predictable performance**:
  Impeller compiles all shaders and reflection offline at build time.
  It builds all pipeline state objects upfront.
  The engine controls caching and caches explicitly.
* **Instrumentable**:
  Impeller tags and labels all graphics resources,
  such as textures and buffers.
  It can capture and persist animations to disk without affecting
  per-frame rendering performance.
* **Portable**:
  Flutter doesn't tie Impeller to a specific client-rendering API.
  You can author shaders once and convert them to backend-specific
  formats, as necessary.
* **Leverages modern graphics APIs**:
  Impeller uses, but doesn't depend on, features available in
  modern APIs like Metal and Vulkan.
* **Leverages concurrency**:
  Impeller can distribute single-frame workloads across multiple
  threads, if necessary.

## Availability

Where can you use Impeller?

### iOS

Flutter **enables Impeller by default** on iOS.

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when debugging,
  pass `--no-enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

  ```console
  flutter run --no-enable-impeller
  ```

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when deploying your app,
  add the following tags under the top-level `<dict>` tag in your
  app's `Info.plist` file.

  ```xml
    <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
    <false />
  ```

The team continues to improve iOS support.
If you encounter performance or fidelity issues
with Impeller on iOS,
file an issue in the [GitHub tracker][file-issue].
Prefix the issue title with `[Impeller]` and
include a small reproducible test case.

[file-issue]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/issues/new/choose

### macOS

As of the 3.19 release,
you can try out Impeller for macOS behind a flag.

To enable Impeller on macOS when debugging,
pass `--enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

```console
flutter run --enable-impeller
```

To enable Impeller on macOS when deploying your app,
add the following tags under the top-level
`<dict>` tag in your app's `Info.plist` file.

```xml
  <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
  <true />
```

### Android

Impeller is available behind a flag on Android
devices that support Vulkan, allowing you to
try out the feature before it reaches stable.

:::secondary Does your device support Vulkan?
You can determine whether your Android device
supports Vulkan at [checking for Vulkan support][vulkan].
:::

To try out Impeller on Vulkan-capable Android devices,
pass `--enable-impeller` to `flutter run`:

```console
flutter run --enable-impeller
```

Or, you can add the following setting to your project's
`AndroidManifest.xml` file under the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
    android:value="true" />
```

The team continues to improve Impeller support.
If you encounter performance or fidelity issues
with Impeller on any platform,
file an issue in the [GitHub tracker][file-issue].
Prefix the issue title with `[Impeller]` and
include a small reproducible test case.

Please include the following information when
submitting an issue for Impeller:

* The device you are running on,
  including the chip information.
