{% include_relative _main-code-note.md  %}

## Run the app

 1. Locate the VS Code status bar (the blue bar at the bottom of the
    window):<br> ![status bar][]{:.mw-100.pt-1.pb-2}
 1. Select a device from the **Device Selector** area.
    For details, see [Quickly switching between Flutter devices][].
    - If no device is available and you want to use a device simulator,
      click **No Devices** and launch a simulator.

      {{site.alert.warning}}
      You may not see **Start iOS Simulator** option when you click **No Devices** in VS Code. If you are on Mac then you may have to run following command in          terminal to launch a simulator.
      ```
      open -a simulator
      ```

      In Android it is not possible to launch iOS simulator.

    - To setup a real device, follow the device-specific instructions on the
      [Install][] page for your OS.
 1. Invoke **Run > Start Debugging** or press <kbd>F5</kbd>.
 1. Wait for the app to launch &mdash; progress is printed
    in the **Debug Console** view.
