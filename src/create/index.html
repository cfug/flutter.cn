        <h2>Flutter Create</h2>
        <p>
            Flutter Create is a contest that challenges you to build something
            interesting, inspiring, and beautiful with Flutter using 5KB or less
            of Dart code. Congratulations to all the winners this year! We were 
            impressed by the ingenuity and creativity of your apps. For everyone who
             submitted an app, thank you.

        <h4>Submission guidelines:</h4>
        <div class="create__text-columns">
            <p>Your application must be submitted in the form of a ZIP file
               containing everything needed to run it on a target Android or
               iOS device.</p>
            <p>You should include a <code>README.md</code> file that includes a
               brief description of the application and any special instructions
               for running it (for example, if the application is designed for a
               specific platform target).</p>
            <p>Code should be licensed with an open source license (we recommend
               BSD, MIT or Apache), so that we can judge it and others can
               benefit from your work.</p>
            <p>We will run the application by unpacking the ZIP file and running
               the command <code>flutter run --release</code> to execute it
               on an attached Android or iOS device.</p>
            <p>The ZIP file may contain other files and directories that are
               created using the flutter create command, such as
               <code>pubspec.yaml</code>; it may also include asset files
               (e.g. images, fonts) or data. We recommend running
               <code>flutter clean</code> before creating the ZIP file to
               strip out unnecessary binaries.</p>
            <p>With the exception of packages (see below), all executable content
               must be included in the ZIP file.</p>
            <p>All code needed to load and execute the application must be
               written in Dart, with the exception of any packages
               (as mentioned below).</p>
            <p>Dart code must appear in a file that has a filename ending in
               <code>.dart</code>. The total size of all Dart files in the ZIP
               file, excluding unit tests that are not executed, must be no
               more than 5,120 bytes as (for example) measured by the
               command <code>find . -name "*.dart" | xargs cat | wc -c</code>.</p>
            <p>The application may use Flutter packages that are a) published
               on <a href="https://pub.dev">pub.dev</a>;
               b) have broad applicability (e.g. not written solely for the
               purpose of circumventing the 5KB file limit, in the opinion
               of the judges).</p>

        <h4>FAQ:</h4>
        <div class="create__text-columns">
            <p>
                <b>What is Flutter Create?</b><br>
                Flutter Create is a contest where new and experienced developers
                can submit a project built using Flutter. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn
                Flutter, try building out interfaces, and possibly win prizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What is the judging criteria?</b><br>
                Each entry will be rated against the following rubric: visual beauty,
                code quality, novelty of idea, and overall execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Who are the judges?</b><br>
                Entries will be judged by members of the Flutter team and
                experienced developers from the Flutter community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What are the deadlines for the project?</b><br>
                You need to have your project submitted by April 7th at
                11:59pm PDT (GMT-7).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>I submitted my project, can I make changes to it?</b><br>
                Yes, as long as your change occurs before April 7th at
                11:59pm PDT (GMT-7).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How will the winners be selected?</b><br>
                Judges will evaluate the entries based on four criteria:
                visual beauty, code quality, novelty of idea, and overall execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>When will the winners be selected?</b><br>
                Winners will be selected around April 25 and announced at Google I/O
                and online.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What are the prizes?</b><br>
                One grand prize winner will receive a customized
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/">iMac Pro 5K</a>;<br>
                Four additional winners will receive a Google Home Max;<br>
                Up to 25 additional winners will receive a Google Home Mini.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Can I submit more than one entry?</b><br>
                We limit entries to one project per participant. We encourage you
                to submit your best entry!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>I already have an approved app, can I submit that for the
                   challenge?</b><br>
                Unfortunately, no. Only new apps or UIs can be submitted for approval.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Is there an age limit to participate?</b><br>
                You must not be a minor (per your local law) to be eligible to win.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Can you use Flare animations? If so, does it count towards the
                   byte size?</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Image, video, font, and other binary asset types are not included
                in the 5KB Dart code limit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Can you store data in a separate file? For example,
                   for a catalog of dogs, can you store the dog data in a json?</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Data is OK. However, we're counting all Dart code in the 5KB limit,
                so the JSON loader would be included.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Do Flutter Create contest submissions have to be formatted
                   by dartfmt?</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can run dartfmt on our side. We believe code quality is
                primarily driven by good structure, rather than indentation.
                But of course, if the code is impenetrable to the judges even
                after running dartfmt, it may be challenging for them to score
                it well for code quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Can a team of people submit a single project?</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                A team of people can submit a single project, but the person
                submitting the project through our form should be authorized
                to submit the project on behalf of the entire team or entity,
                and a winning project from a team is only eligible for 1 prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Should we send just a .dart file or all the files as the
                   given size is 5 kb and all the files would be above 5 kb?</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please submit whatever it takes to build and run your application with
                `flutter run`.
            </p>
