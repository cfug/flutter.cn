## What is it?

Allocated Dart objects created using a class constructor
(for example, by using `new MyClass()` or `MyClass()`)
live in a portion of memory called the heap.

## DevTools memory page

DevTools Memory page lets you peek at how an isolate is using
memory at a given moment. Using Monitor Allocations and
Reset options, you can analyze accumulator counts. The accumulators
can be used to study the rate of memory allocations,
if you suspect your application is leaking memory or has
other bugs relating to memory allocation.

A Snapshot is a complete view of all objects in the Dart memory heap.
Each time a snapshot is taken, an analysis is performed over the memory
data.  The analysis attempts to identify any memory patterns that may
cause leaks or lead to application crashes. For example, loading large
assets for thumbnail-sized images in inefficient, memory usage can
be improved by loading smaller assets or adjusting the cacheWidth/cacheHeight
to decode an image to a smaller size reducing the memory usage of the
ImageCache. The analysis catches issues like this.

Memory profiling consists of six parts, each increasing
in granularity:

* Memory overview chart
* Android-only memory chart (via Android's ADB tool)
* Event timeline (for example, garbage collection (GC)
  events, user memory tooling interactions)
* Monitoring of Dart total instances,
  size and accumulator monitoring to detect memory leaks
* Analysis of a Snapshot to detect possible memory problems
  or Flutter gotchas
* Snapshots of all live memory class instances and sentinels
  (instances to be GC'd)

{{site.alert.note}}
  **Use [profile mode][] when running your app to analyze performance.**
  Memory usage is not indicative of release performance unless your
  application is run in profile mode. In general, memory usage is
  fairly accurate, in relative terms, between debug, release, or
  profile modes. Profile mode might show higher absolute memory usage
  because a service isolate is created to profile your application.
  This isolate won't exist in release mode. Absolute memory used might
  also be higher in debug versus release mode. In release mode,
  work can be computed and optimized ahead of time, while in debug
  mode that same work might have to be computed at runtime,
  requiring more information.

## Memory anatomy

A timeseries graph is used to visualize the state of the Flutter memory
at successive intervals of time. Each data point on the chart
corresponds to the timestamp (x-axis) of measured quantities (y-axis)
of the heap, for example, usage, capacity, external, garbage
collection, and resident set size.

![Screenshot of a memory anatomy page]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_chart_anatomy.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

The major sections of the memory profiler are:

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Event Timeline**</dt>
<dd>The event timeline displays Dart VM and DevTools events on a shared timeline. These events can be snapshots (manual and auto), Dart VM GCs, user requested GCs, or monitor and accumulator reset actions.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Memory Overview Chart**</dt>
<dd>This chart is a timeseries graph that visualizes the state of the Dart heap and external heaps over time.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Android Overview Chart**</dt>
<dd>This chart is specific to an Android app, and it shows Android ADB meminfo from an ADB app summary.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Tree View of Memory**</dt>
<dd>The tree table view displays outstanding memory events (user requested snapshots, automatic snapshots, snapshot analyses, memory allocation monitoring).</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Memory Inspector**</dt>
<dd>Display either the contents of an analysis, snapshot or monitoring based on the currently selected row in the tree view.</dd>
</dl>

## Memory controls

The top of the memory page has several buttons and dropdowns that control how memory data is displayed.

![Screenshot of a memory controls]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_controls.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Pause**</dt>
<dd>Pause the memory overview chart to allow inspecting
    the currently plotted data. Incoming memory data is still received;
    notice the Range selector continues to grow to the right.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Resume**</dt>
<dd>Resume the memory overview chart so that it is live, displaying the
    current time and the latest memory statistics.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Clear**</dt>
<dd>Clear all collected data from the memory profiler.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Display**</dt>
<dd>The duration of the x-axis. For example, if this dropdown
    is set to "Display 5 minutes", memory data from the last
    5 minutes is displayed.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">- Display 1 Minute</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display 5 Minutes</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display 10 Minutes</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display All Minutes (slider disabled)</dt>
<dt markdown="1">**Source**</dt>
<dd>Source can be either "Live Feed", which pulls data from the connected Flutter app, or one of the available offline data files, which are created by clicking "Export".</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Android Memory**</dt>
<dd>Displays or hides the Android Memory Chart.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**GC**</dt>
<dd>Initiates a garbage collection - compaction of the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Export**</dt>
<dd>Saves collected data for Event Timeline, Memory Overview Chart and Android Overview Chart. Files saved are displayed under the Source dropdown. Selecting a file loads the offline data.</dd>
</dl>

## Memory actions

Below the memory charts (Event Timeline, Memory Overview and Android Overview charts) are actions to collect information about memory usage.

![Screenshot of a memory actions]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_actions.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Snapshot**</dt>
<dt markdown="1">**Table**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">If the Treemap switch is off,
    the snapshot displays all currently active memory
    objects in a table. Clicking the **Snapshot** button
    makes a request to the Dart VM to collect the current
    state of memory. The memory objects can be sorted
    by attributes such as class name, size,
    allocated instances (see
    [Snapshot classes](#snapshots)).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Treemap**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">If the Treemap switch is enabled on
    the snapshot displays currently active memory objects,
    the last snapshot, memory in a high-level view as a tree map.
    (TBD details).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Group By**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Dropdown to select how data is grouped,
    which can either be by instance or by class name.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Collapse All**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Collapse all nodes in the table.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Expand All**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Expand all nodes in the table.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Monitor Allocations**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Records the number of instances and the size
    of all instances in bytes. Upon clicking on the
    **Monitor** entry in the table, another table
    populates with instance allocation data.
    For each instance in the allocation table,
    the **Delta** column reflects the number of
    memory allocations since the last reset.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Reset Accumulators**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Resets the accumulator counts
    (**Delta** columns) for each instance in the allocation table.
    The next time the **Monitor** button is pressed,
    the **Delta** columns displays the populate with
    the new instances and sizes since the last reset.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Search**</dt>
<dd>The search field is enabled when a snapshot exists.
    The current selected snapshot, or last snapshot,
    class name is searched (auto-completed).

<dt markdown="1">**Filter**</dt>
<dd>Display a dialog box of libraries and class names to display (checked on).
</dd>
</dl>

## Memory overview chart

![Screenshot of the basic memory chart]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_basic_chart.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This chart is a timeseries graph to help visualize the state of the heap at various points in time.

The chart's x-axis is a timeline of events (timeseries).
In other words, it shows the polled state of the memory
every 500 ms. This helps give a live appearance on the
state of the memory as the application is running.
The quantities plotted on the y-axis are (from top to bottom):

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Legend**</dt>
<dd>All collected measurements regarding the memory.
    Clicking a legend name hides or shows that data.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**X-axis timestamp**</dt>
<dd>Time of the collected memory information
    (capacity, used, external, RSS (resident set size),
    and GC (garbage collection)).</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Hover information of collected data**</dt>
<dd>The collected memory data at a particular point in time (x-axis).</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Capacity**</dt>
<dd>Current capacity of the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Used**</dt>
<dd>Objects (Dart objects) in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**External**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Memory that is not in the Dart heap but
  is still part of the total memory footprint.
  Objects in external memory would be native objects
  (for example, from a memory read from a file,
  or a decoded image). The native objects are exposed to the Dart
  VM from the native OS (such as Android, Linux, Windows, iOS)
  using a Dart embedder. The embedder creates a Dart wrapper with
  a finalizer, allowing the Dart code to communicate with these
  native resources. Flutter has an embedder for Android and iOS.
  For more information, see [Dart on the Server][server] or
  [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders][embedder].
</dd>
</dl>

To view RSS (resident set size), click the name of the RSS located
in the legend.

* The resident set size displays the amount of memory to a process.
  It doesn't include memory that is swapped out. It includes memory
  from shared libraries that are loaded, as well as all stack and
  heap memory.

For more information, see [Dart VM internals][vm].

## Memory android chart (ADB)

When connected to an Android app, DevTools collects Android's ADB (Android Debug Bridge) meminfo from an ADB app summary (polled every 500 ms).  This meminfo section is the most interesting at a high-level.  If you were to collect this info from the ADB tool, this is what it would look like:
```
> adb shell dumpsys meminfo io.flutter.demo.gallery -d

 App Summary
                       Pss(KB)
                       -------
           Java Heap:     5192
         Native Heap:    11992
                Code:     2132
               Stack:       60
            Graphics:    53700
       Private Other:    42800
              System:    84493
 
               TOTAL:   200369       TOTAL SWAP PSS:    82168
```

This chart is another timeseries graph of the state of Android memory as the application is running.
The quantities plotted on the y-axis are the above values (Java Heap, Native Heap, Code size, Stack size, Graphics stack, System size and total).

Clicking on a timestamp (x-position) displays all data points
collected for that time period.

![Screenshot of Android Memory Chart]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_android.png @path %})

The legend popup displays the values of all collected
Android memory data.

![Screenshot of Android Memory Legend]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_android_legend.png @path %})

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Time**</dt>
<dd>The timestamp for the current data values collected - see descriptions below.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Total**</dt>
<dd>The total memory in use. Total memory is comprised of several different categories, all of which are plotted along the y-axis. These categories are described below.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Other**</dt>
<dd>Other memory usage corresponds to the ‘Private Other’ field from ADB. This is memory used by the app that the system isn't sure how to categorize. Note: The Other trace is a combination of Other and System (shared and system memory usage) - corresponds to ‘System’ field from ADB.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Code**</dt>
<dd>Code memory usage corresponds to the ‘Code’ field from ADB. This is memory that your app uses for static code and resources, such as dex byte code, optimized or compiled dex code, .so libraries, and fonts.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Native Heap**</dt>
<dd>Native Heap usage corresponds to the ‘Native Heap’ field from ADB. This is memory from objects allocated from C or C++ code. Even if you're not using C++ in your app, you might see some native memory used here because the Android framework uses native memory to handle various tasks on your behalf. Some examples of these tasks are handling image assets and other graphics—even though the code you've written is in Java or Kotlin.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Java Heap**</dt>
<dd>Java Heap usage corresponds to the ‘Java Heap’ field from ADB. This is memory from objects allocated from Java or Kotlin code.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Stack**</dt>
<dd>Stack usage corresponds to the ‘Stack’ field from ADB. This is memory used by both native and Java stacks in your app. This usually relates to how many threads your app is running.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Graphics**</dt>
<dd>Graphics usage corresponds to the ‘Graphics’ field from ADB. This is memory used for graphics buffer queues to display pixels on the screen, including GL surfaces, GL textures, etc. Note: This is memory shared with the CPU—not dedicated GPU memory.</dd>
</dl>

## Event timeline

![Screenshot of DevTools events]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This chart displays DevTools events (such as manual GC, VM GC,
Snapshot, Monitor Allocations and Reset Accumulators button
clicks) in relation to the memory chart timeline. Hovering over the
markers in the Event timeline displays the time when the event occurred.
This helps identify when a memory leak might have occurred in the
timeline (x-axis).

![Screenshot of the event timeline legend]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline_legend.png @path %})

This legend shows the symbol for each DevTools event and its meaning

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Snapshot**</dt>
![User Snapshot]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline_snapshot.png @path %}){:width="20px"}
<dd markdown="1">User initiated snapshot&mdash;all

<dd markdown="1">DevTools initiated a snapshot detecting
    that memory grow by 40% or more from previous size.
    This is used to detect memory spikes in your
    Flutter application (same information collected as in a

</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Monitor Allocations**</dt>

    garbage collection,
    see [Don't Fear the Garbage Collector][].
</dd>
</dl>

## Managing the objects and statistics in the heap (Monitor Allocations)

![The Monitor Allocations button]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_monitor_allocations.png @path %}){:width="20px"}

Clicking the **Monitor Allocations** button monitors the total
number of instances and total number of bytes allocated for a class.
In addition, two accumulators are maintained for instances
and bytes allocated these accumulators can be reset,
to zero, by user action (pressing the Reset Accumulators button).
The mechanism is useful to find memory leaks.

![Reset Accumulators button]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_reset.png @path %}){:width="20px"}

When the **Reset Accumulators** button is pressed,
the accumulators for all classes reset to zero.
When a reset occurs, a "monitor reset" event is sent to
the **Event Timeline**. Clicking the **Reset Accumulators**
button again resets both accumulators to zero.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Classes**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Active classes in the heap.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Instances column is total active objects for all classes in the heap**</dt>
<dd>Total classes allocated in the heap and total objects (instances) in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Delta column the accumulator count of all instances since last "Reset Accumulators" was pressed.**</dt>
<dd>Clicking the Reset Accumulators button resets the both the accumulated instances count and accumulated instances bytes. This is useful for finding memory leaks.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Bytes column is total bytes consumed for all instances of a class in the heap**</dt>
<dt markdown="1">**Delta column is the accumulator counts since last "Reset Accumulators" was pressed.**</dt>
<dd>Clicking the Reset Accumulators button resets the both the accumulated bytes of all instances of a class. This is useful for finding memory leaks.</dd>
</dl>

## Snapshots

![The Snapshot button]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_snapshot.png @path %})

Clicking the **Snapshot** button shows the current state of the heap with regard to all active classes and their instances. 

![Screenshot of the Snapshot classes]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_snapshot_tree.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This pane shows classes allocated in the heap, all instances for a class, and the ability to inspect a particular instance.

In addition, a snapshot can automatically occur when DevTools notices a spike in memory used (growth of > 40%).

Every snapshot, manual or automatic, generates
an analysis of the snapshot; for example, a group image
problems might have occurred. In the future,
other common Flutter coding issues—such as with fonts, files, or JSON—
that could cause memory problems will be flagged.

Snapshots have major tree nodes:
<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">External</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Memory that is not in the Dart heap but is
  still part of the total memory footprint.
  Objects in external memory would be native objects
  (for example, in memory read from a file,
  or a decoded image). The native objects are exposed to the Dart
  VM from the native OS (such as Android, Linux, Windows, iOS)
  using a Dart embedder. The embedder creates a Dart wrapper with
  a finalizer, allowing Dart code to communicate with these native
  resources. Flutter has an embedder for Android and iOS.
  For more information, see [Dart on the Server][server] or
  [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders][embedder].
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">Filtered</dt>
<dd>Filter are the packages being filtered.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">Packages</dt>
<dd>User packages used by the application and Src - the empty Dart package.</dd>
</dl>

Under each of the above nodes are class nodes,
an aggregate of the objects allocated to this class.
Clicking a class name displays a list of class instances;
under each class all the instances of a class are listed.
Clicking on an instance inspects the contents of that
instance (fields and values).

## Inspecting a class instance in a snapshot

Expanding a class displays the active instances for that class.  Clicking on an particular instance displays the type and value of the fields for that instance.

![Screenshot of the inspecting an instance]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_inspector.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

## Analysis of a snapshot

Every snapshot creates a corresponding Analyzed entry under the Analysis node (the Analyzed date/time corresponds to the matching Snapshot date/time).

![Screenshot of a Snapshot Analysis]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_analysis.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

Currently, Analysis looks for common problems with images e.g., loading large files instead of scaled thumbnails, not using a ListBuilder to manage images in a list, etc.

The Analysis pulls all Image related classes and instances from a snapshot and organizes the data in one place instead of having to search for the all the classes and inspect the instances to understand what are just image related classes.

In the above Analysis the raw images are located in the Externals portion of memory _Int32List (or _Int64List for newer phones) organizes the instances sizes into buckets.  Eleven images are 10K-50K, one image is 10M-50M, seven images are 1M-10M and four images are greater than 50M.  For a grand total of over 500M of this app constitute images rendered as small images on a phone.

## Memory problem case study

<dd markdown="1">A memory leak study using large network
    images was added with step-by-step instructions on
    using DevTools' Memory profiler,
    detecting the memory problem, and fixing the problem.
    For more information, see the [case study][case_study].
</dd>

## Glossary of VM terms

Here are some computer science concepts that help you better
understand how your application uses memory.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Garbage collection (GC)**</dt>
<dd>GC is the process of searching the
    heap to locate, and reclaim, regions of "dead" memory&mdash;memory
    that is no longer being used by an application. This process
    allows the memory to be re-used and minimizes the risk of an
    application running out of memory, causing it to crash. Garbage
    collection is performed automatically by the Dart VM. In DevTools,
    you can perform garbage collection on demand by clicking the
    GC button.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Heap**</dt>
<dd>Dart objects that are dynamically allocated live in a portion of
    memory called the heap. An object allocated from the heap is freed
    (eligible for garbage collection) when nothing points to it,
    or when the application terminates. When nothing points to an
    object, it is considered to be dead. When an object is pointed
    to by another object, it is live.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Isolates**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Dart supports concurrent execution by
    way of isolates, which you can think of processes
    without the overhead. Each isolate has its own memory
    and code that can't be affected by any other isolate.
    For more information,
    see [The Event Loop and Dart][event-loop].
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Memory leak**</dt>
<dd>A memory leak occurs when an object is live
    (meaning that another object points to it), but it is not being
    used (so it shouldn't have any references from other objects).
    Such an object can't be garbage collected, so it takes up space
    in the heap and contributes to memory fragmentation.
    Memory leaks put unnecessary pressure on the VM and can be
    difficult to debug.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Virtual machine (VM)**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">The Dart virtual machine is a piece of
    software that directly executes Dart code.
</dd>
