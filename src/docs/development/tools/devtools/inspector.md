## What is it?

The Flutter widget inspector is a powerful tool for visualizing and
exploring Flutter widget trees. The Flutter framework uses widgets
as the [core building block][] for anything from controls
(such as text, buttons, and toggles),
to layout (such as centering, padding, rows, and columns).
The inspector helps you visualize and explore Flutter widget
trees, and can be used for the following:

* understanding existing layouts
* diagnosing layout issues

## Get started

To debug a layout issue, run the app in [debug mode][] and
open the inspector by clicking the **Flutter Inspector**
tab on the DevTools toolbar.

{{site.alert.note}}
  You can still access the Flutter inspector directly from
  Android Studio/IntelliJ, but you might prefer the
  more spacious view when running it from DevTools
  in a browser. Also note that the UI for the inspector
  varies slightly between these environments. This page
  describes the UI for the DevTools version of the inspector.

### Debugging layout issues visually

The following is a guide to the features available in the
inspector's toolbar. When space is limited, the icon is
used as the visual version of the label.

## Inspecting a widget

You can browse the interactive widget tree to view nearby
widgets and see their field values.

To locate individual UI elements in the widget tree,
click the **Select Widget Mode** button in the toolbar.
This puts the app on the device into a "widget select" mode.
Click any widget in the app's UI; this selects the widget on the
app's screen, and scrolls the widget tree to the corresponding node.
Toggle the **Select Widget Mode** button again to exit
widget select mode.

When debugging layout issues, the key fields to look at are the
`size` and `constraints` fields. The constraints flow down the tree,
and the sizes flow back up. For more information on how this works,
see [Understanding constraints][].

## Flutter Layout Explorer

The Flutter Layout Explorer helps you to better understand
Flutter layouts. Currently, the Layout Explorer only supports
exploration of [flex layouts][], but it may be extended to other
types of layouts in the future.

For an overview of what you can do with this tool, see
the Flutter Explorer video:

### Using the Layout Explorer

From the Flutter Inspector, select a flex widget
(for example, [`Row`][], [`Column`][], [`Flex`][])
or a direct child of a flex widget.
In Flutter 1.12.16 or later,
you'll see the **Layout Explorer** tab next to **Details Tree**.
Select this tab to display the Layout Explorer feature.

![The Layout Explorer tab]({% asset tools/devtools/layout_explorer_tab.png @path %})

The Layout Explorer visualizes how [`Flex`][] widgets and their
children are laid out. The explorer identifies the main axis
and cross axis, as well as the current alignment for each
(for example, start, end, and spaceBetween).
It also shows details like flex factor and layout constraints.

Additionally, the explorer shows layout constraint violations
and render overflow errors. Violated layout constraints
are colored red, and overflow errors are presented in the
standard  "yellow-tape" pattern, as you might see on a running
device. These visualizations aim to improve understanding of
why overflow errors occur as well as how to fix them.

![The Layout Explorer showing errors and device inspector]({% asset tools/devtools/layout_explorer_errors_and_device.gif @path %}){:width="100%"}

Clicking a widget in the layout explorer mirrors
the selection on the on-device inspector. **Select Widget Mode**
needs to be enabled for this. To enable it,
click on the **Select Widget Mode** button in the inspector.

![The Select Widget Mode button in the inspector]({% asset tools/devtools/select_widget_mode_devtools_alpha.png @path %})

For some properties, like flex factor and alignment,
you can modify the value via dropdown lists in the explorer.
When modifying a widget property, you see the new value reflected
not only in the Layout Explorer, but also on the
device running your Flutter app. The explorer animates
on property changes so that the effect of the change is clear.
Widget property changes made from the layout explorer don't
modify your source code and are reverted on hot reload.

### Interactive Properties

Layout Explorer supports modifying [`mainAxisAlignment`][],
[`crossAxisAlignment`][], and [`FlexParentData.flex`][].
In the future, we may add support for additional properties
such as [`mainAxisSize`][], [`textDirection`][], and
[`FlexParentData.fit`][].

#### mainAxisAlignment

![The Layout Explorer changing main axis alignment]({% asset tools/devtools/layout_explorer_main_axis_alignment.gif @path %}){:width="100%"}

Supported values:

* `MainAxisAlignment.start`
* `MainAxisAlignment.end`
* `MainAxisAlignment.center`
* `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween`
* `MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround`
* `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly`


#### crossAxisAlignment

![The Layout Explorer changing cross axis alignment]({% asset tools/devtools/layout_explorer_cross_axis_alignment.gif @path %}){:width="100%"}

Supported values:

* `CrossAxisAlignment.start`
* `CrossAxisAlignment.center`
* `CrossAxisAlignment.end`
* `CrossAxisAlignment.stretch`


#### FlexParentData.flex

![The Layout Explorer changing flex factor]({% asset tools/devtools/layout_explorer_flex.gif @path %}){:width="100%"}

Layout Explorer supports 7 flex options in the UI
(null, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), but technically the flex
factor of a flex widget’s child can be any int.

## Track widget creation

Part of the functionality of the Flutter inspector is based on
instrumenting the application code in order to better understand
the source locations where widgets are created. The source
instrumentation allows the Flutter inspector to present the
widget tree in a manner similar to how the UI was defined
in your source code. Without it, the tree of nodes in the
widget tree are much deeper, and it can be more difficult to
understand how the runtime widget hierarchy corresponds to
your application's UI.

You can disable this feature by passing `--no-track-widget-creation` to
the `flutter run` command.

Here are examples of what your widget tree might look like
with and without track widget creation enabled.

Track widget creation enabled (default):

![The widget tree with track widget creation enabled]({% asset tools/devtools/track_widget_creation_enabled.png @path %})

Track widget creation disabled (not recommended):

![The widget tree with track widget creation disabled]({% asset tools/devtools/track_widget_creation_disabled.png @path %})

This feature prevents otherwise-identical `const` Widgets from
being considered equal in debug builds. For more details, see
the discussion on [common problems when debugging][].
