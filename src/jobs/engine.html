  orchestrates lower-level dependencies such as the Dart VM, Skia,
  the OS, and platform-specific APIs to provide a unified,
  platform-agnostic API to the Flutter framework and applications.</p>

<p>The Flutter team is looking to improve the performance, size, stability
  and graphics beauty provided by the Flutter Engine. To that end, we’re seeking

  <li>Triage and address crash reports to make Flutter apps stable
    and delightful.</li>
