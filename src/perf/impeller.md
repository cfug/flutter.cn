## What is Impeller?

Impeller provides a new rendering runtime for Flutter.
The Flutter team's believes this solves Flutter's
[early-onset jank][] issue.
Impeller precompiles a [smaller, simpler set of shaders][]
at Engine build time so they don't compile at runtime.

For a video introduction to Impeller, check out the following
talk from the Flutter Foward 2023 conference.

Impeller has the following objectives:

* **Predictable performance**:
  Impeller compiles all shaders and reflection offline at build time.
  It builds all pipeline state objects upfront.
  The engine controls caching and caches explicitly.
* **Instrumentable**:
  Impeller tags and labels all graphics resources like textures,
  and buffers.
  It can capture and persist animations to disk without affecting
  per-frame rendering performance.
* **Portable**:
  Flutter doesn't tie Impeller to a specific client rendering API.
  You can author shaders once and convert them to backend-specific
  formats as necessary.
* **Leverages modern graphics APIs**:
  Impeller uses, but doesnâ€™t depend on, features available in
  modern APIs like Metal and Vulkan.
* **Leverages concurrency**:
  Impeller can distribute single-frame workloads across multiple
  threads if necessary.

## Availability

Where can you use Impeller?

### iOS

Flutter enables Impeller by default on iOS.

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when debugging,
  pass `--no-enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

  ```terminal
  $ flutter run --no-enable-impeller
  ```

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when deploying your app,
  add the following tags under the top-level `<dict>` tag in your
  app's `Info.plist` file.

  ```xml
    <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
    <false />
  ```

The team continues to improve iOS support.
If you encounter performance or fidelity issues
with Impeller on iOS, file an issue in the [GitHub tracker][file-issue].
Prefix the issue title with `[Impeller]` and
include a small reproducible test case.

### Android

Android development continues but it's not ready for preview.
Impeller on Android might not work on the `master` channel.
To see what direction Android support will take,
experiment with Impeller in the 3.7 or later stable release.

To enable Impeller on Android, take one of the following actions:

* Pass `--enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

  ```terminal
  $ flutter run --enable-impeller
  ```

* Add the following tag to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file
  under the `<application>` tag.

  ```xml
    <meta-data
      android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
      android:value="true" />
  ```
