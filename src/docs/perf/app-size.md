Many developers are concerned with the size of their compiled app. As the APK,
app bundle, or IPA version of a Flutter app is self-contained and holds all the
code and assets needed to run the app, its size can be a concern. The larger an
app, the more space it requires on a device, the longer it takes to download,
and it may break the limit of useful features like Android instant apps.

## Debug builds are not representative

By default, launching your app with `flutter run`,
or by clicking the **Play** button in your IDE
(as used in [Test drive][] and
[Write your first Flutter app][]),
generates a _debug_ build of the Flutter app.
The app size of a debug build is large due to
the debugging overhead that allows for hot reload
and source-level debugging. As such, it is not representative of a production
app end users download.

## Checking the total size

A default release build, such as one created by `flutter build apk` or
`flutter build ios`, is built to conveniently assemble your upload package
to the Play Store and App Store. As such, they're also not representative of
your end-users' download size. The stores generally reprocess and split
your upload package to target the specific downloader and the downloader's
hardware, such as filtering for assets targeting the phone's DPI, filtering
native libraries targeting the phone's CPU architecture.

### Estimating total size

To get the closest approximate size on each platform, use the following
instructions.

#### Android

Follow the Google [Play Console's instructions][] for checking app download and
install sizes.

Produce an upload package for your application:

```shell
flutter build appbundle
```

Log into your [Google Play Console][]. Upload your application binary by drag
dropping the .aab file.

View the application's download and install size in the **Android vitals** ->
**App size** tab.

{% include app-figure.md image="perf/vital-size.png" alt="App size tab in Google Play Console" %}

The download size is calculated based on an XXXDHPI (~640dpi) device on an
arm64-v8a architecture. Your end users' download sizes may vary depending on
their hardware.

The top tab has a toggle for download size and install size. The page also
contains optimization tips further below.

#### iOS

Create an [Xcode App Size Report][].

First, by configuring the app version and build as described in the
[iOS create build archive instructions][].

Then:

1. Select **Product > Archive** to produce a build archive.
1. In the sidebar of the Xcode Organizer window, select your iOS app,
   then select the build archive you just produced.
1. Click **Distribute App**.
1. Select a method of distribution. **Development** is the simplest if you don't
   intend to distribute the application.
1. In **App Thinning**, select 'all compatible device variants'.
1. Select **Rebuild from Bitcode** (available if bitcode is enabled on your project).
1. Select **Strip Swift symbols**.

Sign and export the IPA. The exported directory contains
`App Thinning Size Report.txt` with details about your projected
application size on different devices and versions of iOS.

The App Size Report for the default demo app in Flutter 1.17 shows:
```
Variant: Runner-7433FC8E-1DF4-4299-A7E8-E00768671BEB.ipa
Supported variant descriptors: [device: iPhone12,1, os-version: 13.0] and [device: iPhone11,8, os-version: 13.0]
App + On Demand Resources size: 5.4 MB compressed, 13.7 MB uncompressed
App size: 5.4 MB compressed, 13.7 MB uncompressed
On Demand Resources size: Zero KB compressed, Zero KB uncompressed
```

In this example, the app has an approximate
download size of 5.4 MB and an approximate
install size of 13.7 MB on an iPhone12,1 ([Model ID / Hardware
number][] for iPhone 11)
and iPhone11,8 (iPhone XR) running iOS 13.0.

To measure an iOS app exactly,
you have to upload a release IPA to Apple’s
App Store Connect ([instructions][])
and obtain the size report from there.
IPAs are commonly larger than APKs as explained
in [How big is the Flutter engine?][], a
section in the Flutter [FAQ][].

## Breaking down the size

Starting in Flutter version 1.22 and DevTools version 0.9.1,
a size analysis tool is included to help developers understand the breakdown
of the release build of their application.

{{site.alert.warning}}
  As stated in the [checking total size](#checking-the-total-size) section
  above, an upload package is not representative of your end users' download
  size. Be aware that redundant native library architectures and asset densities
  seen in the breakdown tool can be filtered by the Play Store and App Store.
{{site.alert.end}}

The size analysis tool is invoked by passing the `--analyze-size` flag when
building:

- `flutter build apk --analyze-size`
- `flutter build appbundle --analyze-size`
- `flutter build ios --analyze-size`
- `flutter build linux --analyze-size`
- `flutter build macos --analyze-size`
- `flutter build windows --analyze-size`

This build is different from a standard release build in two ways.

1. The tool compiles Dart in a way that records code size usage of Dart
   packages.
2. The tool displays a high level summary of the size breakdown
   in the terminal, and leaves a `*-code-size-analysis_*.json` file for more
   detailed analysis in DevTools.

In addition to analyzing a single build, two builds can also be diffed by
loading two `*-code-size-analysis_*.json` files into DevTools. See
[DevTools documentation][] for details.

{% include app-figure.md image="perf/size-summary.png" alt="Size summary of an Android application in terminal" %}

Through the summary, you can get a quick idea of the size usage per category
(such as asset, native code, Flutter libraries, etc). The compiled Dart
native library is further broken down by package for quick analysis.

{{site.alert.warning}}
  This tool on iOS creates a .app rather than an IPA. It also contains bitcode
  which drastically increases the .framework file sizes in the .app.

  Use this tool to evaluate the relative size of the .app's content. To get
  a closer estimate of the download size, reference the
  [Estimating total size](#estimating-total-size) section above.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Deeper analysis in DevTools

The `*-code-size-analysis_*.json` file produced above can be further
analyzed in deeper detail in DevTools where a tree or a treemap view can
break down the contents of the application into the individual file level and
up to function level for the Dart AOT artifact.

This can be done by `flutter pub global run devtools`, selecting
`Open app size tool` and uploading the JSON file.

{% include app-figure.md image="perf/devtools-size.png" alt="Example breakdown of app in DevTools" %}

For further information on using the DevTools app size tool, see
[DevTools documentation][].

## Reducing app size

When building a release version of your app,
consider using the `--split-debug-info` tag.
This tag can dramatically reduce code size.
For an example of using this tag, see
[Obfuscating Dart code][].

Some of the other things you can do to make your app smaller
are:

* Remove unused resources
* Minimize resource imported from libraries
* Compress PNG and JPEG files
