## Web setup

## Web 平台设置

Flutter has support for building web applications in the
`stable` channel. Any app created in Flutter 2 automatically
builds for the web. To add web support to an app created
before web was in stable, follow the instructions on
[Building a web application with Flutter][] 
when you've completed the setup above.

Flutter 现已在 `stable` 渠道支持构建 Web 应用。
使用 Flutter 2 构建的应用会自动支持 Web 渠道，
如果你需要为现有的应用加入 Web 支持，请阅读文档
[使用 Flutter 构建 Web 应用][Building a web application with Flutter]。
