## About the team
Flutter is Google’s new cross-platform UI toolkit that lets designers and developers craft beautiful, native apps for Android, iOS, desktop and web from a single code base. Flutter is poised to change how people build apps, and we’ve seen explosive growth over the last couple of years, leading us to continue to expand our team. Flutter is one of Google’s most significant open source contributions, and is one of the top 10 software repos on GitHub.

Flutter is a well-funded project, and is the magic sauce behind some of Google’s most strategic products including Google Nest Hub, Google Pay, Stadia, Ads, and Classroom. Externally, it’s used by nearly 400,000 apps from companies and brands including WeChat, eBay, Alibaba, Sonos, SHEIN, ByteDance and PUBG. 

Flutter UX is a diverse and high-performing group of individuals deeply embedded in Flutter's development process. We have a track record of publicly advocating for developer UX through [official blog posts](https://medium.com/flutter/search?q=research), [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLSe1bxixuYqL_JU329NrUxRhMf1b2t8w), and [academic publications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290607.3312978?cid=99659035732). Flutter UX is also one of the founding teams of a Google-wide community for advancing human-centered design in programming tools. 

## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor, who will help
guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships, and learning the
systems you’ll need to do your job. Your manager can also help you find mentors
who can coach you as you navigate your career at Google. In addition to formal
mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one
another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team
members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google, we embrace our differences
and are [committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).
In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/),
[Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/)
are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented employees
and their allies with shared values of creating belonging 
across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance
between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and
success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work
or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a
more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.
