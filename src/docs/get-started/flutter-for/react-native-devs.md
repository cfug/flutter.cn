This document is for React Native (RN) developers looking to apply their
existing RN knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter. If you understand
the fundamentals of the RN framework then you can use this document as a
way to get started learning Flutter development.

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and finding
questions that are most relevant to your needs.


## Introduction to Dart for JavaScript Developers

Like React Native, Flutter uses reactive-style views. However, while RN
transpiles to native widgets, Flutter compiles all the way to native code.
Flutter controls each pixel on the screen, which avoids performance problems
caused by the need for a JavaScript bridge.

Dart is an easy language to learn and offers the following features:

* Provides an open-source, scalable programming language for building web,
  server, and mobile apps.
* Provides an object-oriented, single inheritance language that uses a C-style
  syntax that is AOT-compiled into native.
* Transcompiles optionally into JavaScript.
* Supports interfaces and abstract classes.

A few examples of the differences between JavaScript and Dart are described
below.

### Entry point

JavaScript doesn't have a pre-defined entry function—you define the entry point.

```js
// JavaScript
function startHere() {
  // Can be used as entry point
}
```
In Dart, every app must have a top-level `main()` function that serves as the
entry point to the app.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
main() {
}
```

Try it out in [DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/0df636e00f348bdec2bc1c8ebc7daeb1).

### Printing to the console

To print to the console in Dart, use `print()`.

```js
// JavaScript
console.log("Hello world!");
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
print('Hello world!');
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/cf9e652f77636224d3e37d96dcf238e5).

### Variables

Dart is type safe—it uses a combination of static type checking and runtime
checks to ensure that a variable’s value always matches the variable’s static
type. Although types are mandatory, some type annotations are optional because
Dart performs type inference.

#### Creating and assigning variables

In JavaScript, variables cannot be typed.

In [Dart]({{site.dart-site}}/dart-2), variables must either be explicitly
typed or the type system must infer the proper type automatically.

```js
// JavaScript
var name = "JavaScript";
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
String name = 'dart'; // Explicitly typed as a string.
var otherName = 'Dart'; // Inferred string.
// Both are acceptable in Dart.
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/3f4625c16e05eec396d6046883739612).

For more information, see [Dart's Type
System]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/sound-dart).

#### Default value

In JavaScript, uninitialized variables are `undefined`.

In Dart, uninitialized variables have an initial value of `null`. Because
numbers are objects in Dart, even uninitialized variables with numeric types
have the value `null`.

```js
// JavaScript
var name; // == undefined
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
var name; // == null
int x; // == null
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/57ec21faa8b6fe2326ffd74e9781a2c7).

For more information, see the documentation on
[variables]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/language-tour#variables).

### Checking for null or zero

In JavaScript, values of 1 or any non-null objects are treated as true.

```js
// JavaScript
var myNull = null;
if (!myNull) {
  console.log("null is treated as false");
}
var zero = 0;
if (!zero) {
  console.log("0 is treated as false");
}
```
In Dart, only the boolean value `true` is treated as true.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
var myNull = null;
if (myNull == null) {
  print('use "== null" to check null');
}
var zero = 0;
if (zero == 0) {
  print('use "== 0" to check zero');
}
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/c85038ad677963cb6dc943eb1a0b72e6).

### Functions

Dart and JavaScript functions are generally similar. The primary difference is
the declaration.

```js
// JavaScript
function fn() {
  return true;
}
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
fn() {
  return true;
}
// can also be written as
bool fn() {
  return true;
}
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/5454e8bfadf3000179d19b9bc6be9918).

For more information, see the documentation on
[functions]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/language-tour#functions).

### Asynchronous programming

#### Futures

Like JavaScript, Dart supports single-threaded execution. In JavaScript,
the Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure)
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Dart uses [`Future`]({{site.dart-site}}/tutorials/language/futures)
objects to handle this.

```js
// JavaScript
_getIPAddress = () => {
  const url="https://httpbin.org/ip";
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(responseJson => {
      console.log(responseJson.origin);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
};
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
_getIPAddress() {
  final url = 'https://httpbin.org/ip';
  HttpRequest.request(url).then((value) {
      print(json.decode(value.responseText)['origin']);
  }).catchError((error) => print(error));
}
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/5a0017d09b6823d0248d965b93133e2e).

For more information, see the documentation on
[Futures]({{site.dart-site}}/tutorials/language/futures).

#### `async` and `await`

The `async` function declaration defines an asynchronous function.

In JavaScript, the `async` function returns a `Promise`. The `await` operator is
used to wait for a `Promise`.

```js
// JavaScript
async _getIPAddress() {
  const url="https://httpbin.org/ip";
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const json = await response.json();
  const data = await json.origin;
  console.log(data);
}
```

In Dart, an `async` function returns a `Future`, and the body of the function is
scheduled for execution later. The `await` operator is used to wait for a
`Future`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
_getIPAddress() async {
  final url = 'https://httpbin.org/ip';
  var request = await HttpRequest.request(url);
  String ip = json.decode(request.responseText)['origin'];
  print(ip);
}
```

Try it out in
[DartPad]({{site.dartpad}}/04bb4334985107cddcd021322398c918).

For more information, see the documentation for [`async` and
`await`]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/language-tour#asynchrony-support).

## The basics
### How do I create a Flutter app?

To create an app using React Native, you would run `create-react-native-app`
from the command line.

{% prettify %}
$ create-react-native-app <projectname>
{% endprettify%}

To create an app in Flutter, do one of the following:

* Use the `flutter create` command from the command line. Make sure that the
  Flutter SDK is in your PATH.
* Use an IDE with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

{% prettify %}
$ flutter create <projectname>
{% endprettify%}

For more information, see [Getting Started](/docs/get-started), which
walks you through creating a button-click counter app. Creating a Flutter
project builds all the files that you need to run a sample app on both Android
and iOS devices.

### How do I run my app?

In React Native, you would run `npm run` or `yarn run` from the project
 directory.

 You can run Flutter apps in a couple of ways:

 * Use `flutter run` from the project's root directory.
 * Use the "run" option in an IDE with the Flutter and Dart plugins.

 Your app runs on a connected device, the iOS simulator, or the Android emulator.

For more information, see the Flutter [Getting Started](/docs/get-started) documentation.

### How do I import widgets?

In React Native, you need to import each required component.

```js
//React Native
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
```

In Flutter, to use widgets from the Material Design library, import the `material.dart` package. To use iOS style widgets, import the Cupertino library. To use a more basic widget set, import the Widgets library. Or, you can write your own widget library and import that.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:flutter/my_widgets.dart';
```
Whichever widget package you import, Dart pulls in only the widgets that are
 used in your app.

For more information, see the [Flutter Widgets Catalog](/docs/development/ui/widgets).

### What is the equivalent of the React Native "Hello world!" app in Flutter?

In React Native, the `HelloWorldApp` class extends `React.Component` and
implements the render method by returning a view component.

```js
// React Native
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>Hello world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center"
  }
});
```

In Flutter, you can create an identical "Hello world!" app using the `Center` and `Text` widgets from the core widget library. The `Center` widget becomes the root of the widget tree and has one child, the `Text` widget.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, world!',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      ),
    ),
  );
}

```

The following images show the Android and iOS UI for the basic Flutter
"Hello world!" app.

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/hello-world-basic.png" alt="Hello world app" class="border" %}

Now that you've seen the most basic Flutter app, the next section shows how to
take advantage of Flutter's rich widget libraries to create a modern, polished
app.

### How do I use widgets and nest them to form a widget tree?

In Flutter, almost everything is a widget.

Widgets are the basic building blocks of an app's user interface. You compose
widgets into a hierarchy, called a widget tree. Each widget nests inside a
parent widget and inherits properties from its parent. Even the application
object itself is a widget. There is no separate “application” object. Instead,
the root widget serves this role.

A widget can define:

* A structural element—like a button or menu
* A stylistic element—like a font or color scheme
* An aspect of layout—like padding or alignment

The following example shows the "Hello world!" app using widgets from the
Material library. In this example, the widget tree is nested inside the
`MaterialApp` root widget.


<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Welcome to Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Welcome to Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello world'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


The following images show "Hello world!" built from Material Design widgets. You get more functionality for free than in the basic "Hello world!" app.

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/hello-world.png" alt="Hello world app" %}

When writing an app, you'll use two types of widgets:
[StatelessWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html) or
 [StatefulWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html).
A StatelessWidget is just what it sounds like—a
 widget with no state. A StatelessWidget is created once, and never changes its
  appearance. A StatefulWidget dynamically changes state based on data
   received, or user input.

The important difference between stateless and stateful widgets is that
 StatefulWidgets have a State object that stores state data and carries it over
  across tree rebuilds, so it's not lost.

In simple or basic apps it's easy to nest widgets, but as the code base gets
larger and the app becomes complex, you should break deeply nested widgets into
functions that return the widget or smaller classes. Creating separate functions
and widgets allows you to reuse the components within the app.

### How do I create reusable components?

In React Native, you would define a class to create a reusable component and then use
`props` methods to set or return properties and values of the selected elements.
In the example below, the `CustomCard` class is defined and then used inside a
parent class.

```js
// React Native
class CustomCard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text> Card {this.props.index} </Text>
        <Button
          title="Press"
          onPress={() => this.props.onPress(this.props.index)}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

// Usage
<CustomCard onPress={this.onPress} index={item.key} />
```

In Flutter, define a class to create a custom widget and then reuse the
widget. You can also define and call a function that returns a reusable widget
as shown in the `build` function in the following example.

{% prettify dart %}

// Flutter
class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget {
  [[highlight]]CustomCard({@required this.index, @required [[/highlight]]
     [[highlight]]this.onPress});[[/highlight]]

  final index;
  final Function onPress;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Card $index'),
          FlatButton(
            child: const Text('Press'),
            onPressed: this.onPress,
          ),
        ],
      )
    );
  }
}
    ...
// Usage
CustomCard(
  [[highlight]]index: index,[[/highlight]]
  [[highlight]]onPress: () { [[/highlight]]
    print('Card $index');
  },
)
    ...

{% endprettify %}

In the previous example, the constructor for the `CustomCard` class uses Dart's curly brace syntax `{ }` to indicate named [optional
parameters]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/language-tour#optional-parameters).

To require these fields, either remove the curly braces from the constructor, or
add `@required` to the constructor.



The following screenshots show an example of the reusable CustomCard class.

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/custom-cards.png" alt="Custom cards" class="border" %}


## Project structure and resources

### Where do I start writing the code?

Start with the `main.dart` file. It's autogenerated when you create a
Flutter app.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
void main(){
 print("Hello, this is the main function.");
}
```

In Flutter, the entry point file is `’projectname’/lib/main.dart` and execution
starts from the `main` function.

### How are files structured in a Flutter app?

When you create a new Flutter project, it builds the following directory structure. You can customize it later, but this is where you start.

```
┬
└ projectname
  ┬
  ├ android      - Contains Android-specific files.
  ├ build        - Stores iOS and Android build files.
  ├ ios          - Contains iOS-specific files.
  ├ lib          - Contains externally accessible Dart source files.
    ┬
    └ src        - Contains additional source files.
    └ main.dart  - The Flutter entry point and the start of a new app.
                   This is generated automatically when you create a Flutter
                    project.
                   It's where you start writing your Dart code.
  ├ test         - Contains automated test files.
  └ pubspec.yaml - Contains the metadata for the Flutter app.
                   This is equivalent to the package.json file in React Native.
```

### Where do I put my resources and assets and how do I use them?

A Flutter resource or asset is a file that is bundled and deployed with your app
and is accessible at runtime. Flutter apps can include the following asset
types:
* Static data such as JSON files
* Configuration files
* Icons and images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, Animated GIF, WebP, Animated WebP, BMP,
  and WBMP)

Flutter uses the `pubspec.yaml` file, located at the root of your project, to
identify assets required by an app.

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/my_icon.png
    - assets/background.png
```

The `assets` subsection specifies files that should be included with the app.
Each asset is identified by an explicit path relative to the `pubspec.yaml`
file, where the asset file is located. The order in which the assets are
declared does not matter. The actual directory used (`assets` in this case) does
not matter. However, while assets can be placed in any app directory, it's a
best practice to place them in the `assets` directory.

During a build, Flutter places assets into a special archive called the *asset
bundle*, which apps read from at runtime. When an asset’s path is specified in
the assets section of `pubspec.yaml`, the build process looks for any files with
the same name in adjacent subdirectories. These files are also included in the
asset bundle along with the specified asset. Flutter uses asset variants when
choosing resolution-appropriate images for your app.

In React Native, you would add a static image by placing the image file in a
source code directory and referencing it.

```js
<Image source={require("./my-icon.png")} />
```

In Flutter, add a static image to your app using the `AssetImage` class in a
widget’s build method.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'),
```

For more information, see [Adding Assets and Images in
Flutter](/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images).

### How do I load images over a network?

In React Native, you would specify the `uri` in the `source` prop of the `Image`
component and also provide the size if needed.

In Flutter, use the `Image.network` constructor to include an image from a URL.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
body: Image.network(
          'https://flutter.io/images/owl.jpg',
```

### How do I install packages and package plugins?

Flutter supports using shared packages contributed by other developers to the
Flutter and Dart ecosystems. This allows you to quickly build your app without
having to develop everything from scratch. Packages that contain
platform-specific code are known as package plugins.

In React Native, you would use `yarn add {package-name}` or `npm install --save
{package-name}` to install packages from the command line.

In Flutter, install a package using the following instructions:

1. Add the package name and version to the `pubspec.yaml` dependencies section.
The example below shows how to add the `google_sign_in` Dart package to the
`pubspec.yaml` file. Check your spaces when working in the YAML file because
**white space matters**!

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_sign_in: ^3.0.3
```

2. Install the package from the command line by using `flutter pub get`.
   If using an IDE, it often runs `flutter pub get` for you, or it might
   prompt you to do so.
3. Import the package into your app code as shown below:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
```

For more information, see [Using
Packages](/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages) and
[Developing Packages &
Plugins](/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages).

You can find many packages shared by Flutter developers in the [Flutter
Packages]({{site.pub}}/flutter/) section of
the [Pub site]({{site.pub}}).

## Flutter widgets

In Flutter, you build your UI out of widgets that describe what their view
should look like given their current configuration and state.

Widgets are often composed of many small, single-purpose widgets that are nested
to produce powerful effects. For example, the Container widget consists of
several widgets responsible for layout, painting, positioning, and sizing.
Specifically, the `Container` widget includes the `LimitedBox`,
`ConstrainedBox`, `Align`, `Padding`, `DecoratedBox`, and `Transform` widgets.
Rather than subclassing `Container` to produce a customized effect, you can
compose these and other simple widgets in new and unique ways.

The `Center` widget is another example of how you can control the layout. To
center a widget, wrap it in a `Center` widget and then use layout
widgets for alignment, row, columns, and grids. These layout widgets do not have
a visual representation of their own. Instead, their sole purpose is to control
some aspect of another widget’s layout. To understand why a widget renders in a
certain way, it’s often helpful to inspect the neighboring widgets.

For more information, see the [Flutter Technical
Overview](/docs/resources/technical-overview).

For more information about the core widgets from the Widgets package, see
[Flutter Basic Widgets](/docs/development/ui/widgets/basics), the
[Flutter Widget Catalog](/docs/development/ui/widgets), or the
[Flutter Widget Index](/docs/reference/widgets).

## Views

### What is the equivalent of the `View` container?

In React Native, `View` is a container that supports layout with `Flexbox`,
style, touch handling, and accessibility controls.

In Flutter, you can use the core layout widgets in the Widgets library, such
as  [Container]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html),
[Column]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html),
[Row]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html),
and [Center]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html).

For more information, see the [Layout Widgets](/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout) catalog.

### What is the equivalent of `FlatList` or `SectionList`?

A `List` is a scrollable list of components arranged vertically.

In React Native, `FlatList` or `SectionList` are used to render simple or
sectioned lists.

```js
// React Native
<FlatList
  data={[ ... ]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.key}</Text>}
/>
```

[`ListView`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
is Flutter's most commonly used scrolling widget. The default constructor
takes an explicit list of children.
[`ListView`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
is most appropriate for a small number of widgets. For a large or infinite list,
use `ListView.builder`, which builds its children on demand and only builds
those children that are visible.


<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
var data = [ ... ];
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: data.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, int index) {
    return Text(
      data[index],
    );
  },
)
```

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/flatlist.gif" alt="Flat list" class="border" %}

To learn how to implement an infinite scrolling list, see the
[Write Your First Flutter App,
Part 1]({{site.codelabs}}/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1) codelab.

### How do I use a Canvas to draw or paint?

In React Native, canvas components aren't present so third party libraries like `react-native-canvas` are used.

```js
// React Native
handleCanvas = canvas => {
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.fillStyle = "skyblue";
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(75, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillRect(150, 100, 300, 300);
  ctx.stroke();
};

render() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Canvas ref={this.handleCanvas} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
In Flutter, you can use the
[`CustomPaint`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/CustomPaint-class.html)
and [`CustomPainter`]({{site.api}}/flutter/rendering/CustomPainter-class.html)
classes to draw to the canvas.

The following example shows how to draw during the paint phase using the
`CustomPaint` widget. It implements the abstract class, CustomPainter,
and passes it to CustomPaint's painter property. CustomPaint subclasses
must implement the `paint` and `shouldRepaint` methods.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
class MyCanvasPainter extends CustomPainter {

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    Paint paint = Paint();
    paint.color = Colors.amber;
    canvas.drawCircle(Offset(100.0, 200.0), 40.0, paint);
    Paint paintRect = Paint();
    paintRect.color = Colors.lightBlue;
    Rect rect = Rect.fromPoints(Offset(150.0, 300.0), Offset(300.0, 400.0));
    canvas.drawRect(rect, paintRect);
  }

  bool shouldRepaint(MyCanvasPainter oldDelegate) => false;
  bool shouldRebuildSemantics(MyCanvasPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
class _MyCanvasState extends State<MyCanvas> {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: CustomPaint(
        painter: MyCanvasPainter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/canvas.png" alt="Canvas" class="border" %}

## Layouts

### How do I use widgets to define layout properties?

In React Native, most of the layout can be done with the props that are passed
to a specific component. For example, you could use the `style` prop on the
`View` component in order to specify the flexbox properties. To arrange your
components in a column, you would specify a prop such as:
`flexDirection: “column”`.

```js
// React Native
<View
  style={%raw%}{{
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "space-between",
    alignItems: "center"
  }}{%endraw%}
>
```

In Flutter, the layout is primarily defined by widgets specifically designed to
 provide layout, combined with control widgets and their style properties.

For example, the
[Column]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) and
[Row]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) widgets
take an array of children and align them vertically and horizontally respectively.
A [Container]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)
widget takes a combination of layout and styling properties, and a
[`Center`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html) widget centers
its child widgets.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
Center(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        width: 100.0,
        height: 100.0,
      ),
      Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        width: 100.0,
        height: 100.0,
      ),
      Container(
        color: Colors.green,
        width: 100.0,
        height: 100.0,
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

Flutter provides a variety of layout widgets in its core widget library.
For example, [`Padding`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html),
[`Align`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Align-class.html),
and [`Stack`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html).

For a complete list, see [Layout Widgets](/docs/development/ui/widgets/layout).

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/basic-layout.gif" alt="Layout" class="border" %}

### How do I layer widgets?

In React Native, components can be layered using `absolute` positioning.

Flutter uses the
[`Stack`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html)
widget to arrange children widgets in layers.
The widgets can entirely or partially overlap the base widget.

The `Stack` widget positions its children relative to the edges of its box.
This class is useful if you simply want to overlap several children widgets.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
Stack(
  alignment: const Alignment(0.6, 0.6),
  children: <Widget>[
    CircleAvatar(
      backgroundImage: NetworkImage(
        "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14101776?v=4"),
    ),
    Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.black45,
      ),
      child: Text('Flutter'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

The previous example uses `Stack` to overlay a Container (that displays its `Text`
on a translucent black background) on top of a `CircleAvatar`. The Stack offsets
the text using the alignment property and Alignment coordinates.

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/stack.png" alt="Stack" class="border" %}

For more information, see the
[Stack]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html) class documentation.

## Styling

### How do I style my components?

In React Native, inline styling and `stylesheets.create` are used to style
components.

```js
// React Native
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text style={%raw%}{{ fontSize: 32, color: "cyan", fontWeight: "600" }}{%endraw%}>
    This is a sample text
  </Text>
</View>

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center"
  }
});
```

In Flutter, a `Text` widget can take a `TextStyle` class for its style property.
If you want to use the same text style in multiple places, you can create a
[`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/TextStyle-class.html)
class and use it for multiple `Text` widgets.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
var textStyle = TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0, color: Colors.cyan, fontWeight:
   FontWeight.w600);
	...
Center(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      Text(
        'Sample text',
        style: textStyle,
      ),
      Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Icon(Icons.lightbulb_outline,
          size: 48.0, color: Colors.redAccent)
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/flutterstyling.gif" alt="Styling" class="border" %}

### How do I use `Icons` and `Colors`?

React Native doesn't include support for icons so third party libraries are used.

In Flutter, importing the Material library also pulls in the rich set of
[Material icons]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Icons-class.html)
and [colors]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Colors-class.html).

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Icon(Icons.lightbulb_outline, color: Colors.redAccent)
```

When using the `Icons` class, make sure to set `uses-material-design: true` in
the project's `pubspec.yaml` file. This ensures that
the `MaterialIcons` font, which displays the icons, is included in your app.
{% prettify dart %}
name: my_awesome_application
flutter: [[highlight]]uses-material-design: true[[/highlight]]
{% endprettify %}

Flutter's [Cupertino (iOS-style)](/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino) package provides high
fidelity widgets for the current iOS design language. To use the `CupertinoIcons`
font, add a dependency for `cupertino_icons` in your project's  `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
name: my_awesome_application
dependencies:
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0
```

To globally customize the colors and styles of components, use `ThemeData`
to specify default colors for various aspects of the theme. Set the theme
property in `MaterialApp` to the `ThemeData` object. The
[`Colors`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Colors-class.html)
class provides colors from the Material Design [color
palette]({{site.material}}/guidelines/style/color.html).

The following example sets the primary swatch to `blue` and the text
selection to `red`.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        [[highlight]]primarySwatch: Colors.blue,[[/highlight]]
        [[highlight]]textSelectionColor: Colors.red[[/highlight]]
      ),
      home: SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

### How do I add style themes?

In React Native, common themes are defined for components in stylesheets and
then used in components.

In Flutter, create uniform styling for almost everything by defining the
 styling in the
[`ThemeData`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html)
class and passing it to the theme property in the
[`MaterialApp`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)
widget.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.cyan,
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
      ),
      home: StylingPage(),
    );
  }
```

A `Theme` can be applied even without using the `MaterialApp` widget. The
[`Theme`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Theme-class.html)
widget takes a `ThemeData` in its `data` parameter and applies the
`ThemeData` to all of its children widgets.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
 @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Theme(
      data: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.cyan,
        brightness: brightness,
      ),
      child: Scaffold(
         backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).primaryColor,
              ...
              ...
      ),
    );
  }
```

## State Management

State is information that can be read synchronously when a widget is built
or information that might change during the lifetime of a widget.
To manage app state in Flutter, use a
[StatefulWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
paired with a State object.

### The StatelessWidget

A `StatelessWidget` in Flutter is a widget that doesn't require a state
change&mdash;it has no internal state to manage.

Stateless widgets are useful when the part of the user interface you are
describing does not depend on anything other than the configuration information
in the object itself and the
[`BuildContext`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html)
in which the widget is inflated.

[AboutDialog]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/AboutDialog-class.html),
[CircleAvatar]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/CircleAvatar-class.html),
and [Text]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) are examples
of stateless widgets which subclass
[StatelessWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).


<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyStatelessWidget(text: "StatelessWidget Example to show immutable data"));

class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  MyStatelessWidget({Key key, this.text}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        text,
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the previous example, you used the constructor of the `MyStatelessWidget` class
to pass the `text`, which is marked as `final`. This class extends
 `StatelessWidget`&mdash;it contains immutable data.

The `build` method of a stateless widget is typically called in only three
 situations:

* When the widget is inserted into a tree
* When the widget's parent changes its configuration
* When an
  [`InheritedWidget`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html)
  it depends on, changes

### The StatefulWidget

A [StatefulWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
is a widget that changes state. Use the `setState` method to manage the
state changes for a `StatefulWidget`. A call to `setState` tells the Flutter
framework that something has changed in a state, which causes an app to
rerun the `build` method so that the app can reflect the change.

State is information that can be read synchronously when a widget is built and
might change during the lifetime of the widget. It's the responsibility of the
widget implementer to ensure that the state is promptly notified when the state
changes. Use `StatefulWidget` when a widget can change dynamically.
For example, the state of the widget changes by typing into a form,
or moving a slider. Or, it can change over time—perhaps a data feed updates the UI.

[Checkbox]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Checkbox-class.html),
[Radio]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Radio-class.html),
[Slider]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Slider-class.html),
[InkWell]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html),
[Form]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html),
and [TextField]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TextField-class.html)
are examples of stateful widgets, that subclass
[StatefulWidget]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html).

The following example declares a `StatefulWidget` which requires a `createState()`
method. This method creates the state object that manages the widget's state,
`_MyStatefulWidgetState`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  MyStatefulWidget({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}
```

The following state class, `_MyStatefulWidgetState`, implements the `build()`
method for the widget. When the state changes, for example, when the user toggles
the button, `setState` is called with the new toggle value. This causes the
framework to rebuild this widget in the UI.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  bool showtext=true;
  bool toggleState=true;
  Timer t2;

  void toggleBlinkState(){
    setState((){
      toggleState=!toggleState;
    });
    var twenty = const Duration(milliseconds: 1000);
    if(toggleState==false) {
      t2 = Timer.periodic(twenty, (Timer t) {
        toggleShowText();
      });
    } else {
      t2.cancel();
    }
  }

  void toggleShowText(){
    setState((){
      showtext=!showtext;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            (showtext
              ?(Text('This execution will be done before you can blink.'))
              :(Container())
            ),
            Padding(
              padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 70.0),
              child: RaisedButton(
                onPressed: toggleBlinkState,
                child: (toggleState
                  ?( Text('Blink'))
                  :(Text('Stop Blinking'))
                )
              )
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### What are the StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget best practices?

Here are a few things to consider when designing your widget.

#### 1. Determine whether a widget should be a StatefulWidget or a StatelessWidget


In Flutter, widgets are either Stateful or Stateless—depending on whether
they depend on a state change.

* If a widget changes—the user interacts with it or a data feed interrupts
  the UI, then it’s Stateful.
* If a widget is final or immutable, then it's Stateless.

#### 2. Determine which object manages the widget’s state (for a StatefulWidget)

In Flutter, there are three primary ways to manage state:

* The widget manages its own state
* The parent widget manages the widget’s state
* A mix-and-match approach

When deciding which approach to use, consider the following principles:

* If the state in question is user data, for example the checked or unchecked
  mode of a checkbox, or the position of a slider, then the state is best managed
  by the parent widget.
* If the state in question is aesthetic, for example an animation, then the
  widget itself best manages the state.
* When in doubt, let the parent widget manage the child widget's state.

#### 3. Subclass StatefulWidget and State

The `MyStatefulWidget` class manages its own state—it extends
`StatefulWidget`, it overrides the `createState()` method to create the State
object, and the framework calls `createState()` to build the widget. In this
example, `createState()` creates an instance of `_MyStatefulWidgetState`, which
is implemented in the next best practice.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  MyStatefulWidget({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    ...
  }
}
```

#### 4. Add the StatefulWidget into the widget tree

Add your custom `StatefulWidget` to the widget tree in the app’s build method.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyStatefulWidget(title: 'State Change Demo'),
    );
  }
}
```

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/state-change.gif" alt="State change" class="border" %}

## Props

In React Native, most components can be customized when they are created with
different parameters or properties, called `props`. These
parameters can be used in a child component using `this.props`.

```js
// React Native
class CustomCard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text> Card {this.props.index} </Text>
        <Button
          title="Press"
          onPress={() => this.props.onPress(this.props.index)}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
class App extends React.Component {

  onPress = index => {
    console.log("Card ", index);
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <FlatList
          data={[ ... ]}
          renderItem={({ item }) => (
            <CustomCard onPress={this.onPress} index={item.key} />
          )}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In Flutter, you assign a local variable or function marked `final` with the
 property received in the parameterized constructor.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget {

  CustomCard({@required this.index, @required this.onPress});
  final index;
  final Function onPress;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Card(
    child: Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Card $index'),
        FlatButton(
          child: const Text('Press'),
          onPressed: this.onPress,
        ),
      ],
    ));
  }
}
    ...
//Usage
CustomCard(
  index: index,
  onPress: () {
    print('Card $index');
  },
)
```

{% include android-ios-figure-pair.md image="react-native/modular.png" alt="Cards" class="border" %}

## Local storage

If you don't need to store a lot of data and it doesn't require
structure, you can use `shared_preferences` which allows you to
read and write persistent key-value pairs of primitive data
types: booleans, floats, ints, longs, and strings.

### How do I store persistent key-value pairs that are global to the app?

In React Native, you use the `setItem` and `getItem` functions of the
`AsyncStorage` component to store and retrieve data that is persistent and
global to the app.

```js
// React Native
await AsyncStorage.setItem( "counterkey", json.stringify(++this.state.counter));
AsyncStorage.getItem("counterkey").then(value => {
  if (value != null) {
    this.setState({ counter: value });
  }
});
```

In Flutter, use the
[`shared_preferences`]({{site.github}}/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/shared_preferences)
plugin to store and retrieve key-value data that is persistent and global
to the app. The `shared_preferences` plugin wraps `NSUserDefaults` on iOS
and `SharedPreferences` on Android, providing a persistent store for simple data.
To use the plugin, add `shared_preferences` as a dependency in the `pubspec.yaml`
file then import the package in your Dart file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences: ^0.4.3
```

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

To implement persistent data, use the setter methods provided by the
`SharedPreferences` class. Setter methods are available for various primitive
types, such as `setInt`, `setBool`, and `setString`. To read data, use the
appropriate getter method provided by the `SharedPreferences` class. For each
setter there is a corresponding getter method, for example, `getInt`, `getBool`,
and `getString`.


<!-- skip -->
```dart
SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
_counter = prefs.getInt('counter');
prefs.setInt('counter', ++_counter);
setState(() {
  _counter = _counter;
});
```


## Routing

Most apps contain several screens for displaying different types of information.
For example, you might have a product screen that displays images where users
could tap on a product image to get more information about the product on a new
screen.

In Android, new screens are new Activities. In iOS, new screens are new
ViewControllers. In Flutter, screens are just Widgets! And to navigate to new
screens in Flutter, use the Navigator widget.

### How do I navigate between screens?

In React Native, there are three main navigators: StackNavigator, TabNavigator,
and DrawerNavigator. Each provides a way to configure and define the screens.

```js
// React Native
const MyApp = TabNavigator(
  { Home: { screen: HomeScreen }, Notifications: { screen: tabNavScreen } },
  { tabBarOptions: { activeTintColor: "#e91e63" } }
);
const SimpleApp = StackNavigator({
  Home: { screen: MyApp },
  stackScreen: { screen: StackScreen }
});
export default (MyApp1 = DrawerNavigator({
  Home: {
    screen: SimpleApp
  },
  Screen2: {
    screen: drawerScreen
  }
}));
```

In Flutter, there are two main widgets used to navigate between screens:
* A [Route]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Route-class.html)
  is an abstraction for an app screen or page.
* A [Navigator]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html)
  is a widget that manages routes.

A `Navigator` is defined as a widget that manages a set of child widgets with a
stack discipline. The navigator manages a stack of `Route` objects and provides
methods for managing the stack, like
[`Navigator.push`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Navigator/push.html)
and [`Navigator.pop`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Navigator/pop.html).
A list of routes might be specified in the
[`MaterialApp`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)
widget, or they might be built on the fly, for example, in hero animations.
The following example specifies named routes in the `MaterialApp` widget.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
class NavigationApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
            ...
      routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
        '/a': (BuildContext context) => usualNavscreen(),
        '/b': (BuildContext context) => drawerNavscreen(),
      }
            ...
  );
  }
}
```

To navigate to a named route, the
[of]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Navigator/of.html)
method of the `Navigator` widget is used to specify the `BuildContext`
(a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree).
The name of the route is passed to the `pushNamed` function to
navigate to the specified route.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/a');
```

You can also use the push method of `Navigator` which adds the given
[`route`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Route-class.html)
to the history of the navigator that most tightly encloses the given
[`context`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html),
and transitions to it. In the following example, the
[`MaterialPageRoute`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/MaterialPageRoute-class.html)
widget is a modal route that replaces the entire screen with a platform-adaptive
transition. It takes a
[`WidgetBuilder`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/WidgetBuilder.html)
as a required parameter.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (BuildContext context)
 => UsualNavscreen()));
```

### How do I use tab navigation and drawer navigation?

In Material Design apps, there are two primary options for Flutter navigation:
tabs and drawers. When there is insufficient space to support tabs, drawers
provide a good alternative.


#### Tab navigation

In React Native, `createBottomTabNavigator` and `TabNavigation`  are used to
show tabs and for tab navigation.

```js
// React Native
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from 'react-navigation';

const MyApp = TabNavigator(
  { Home: { screen: HomeScreen }, Notifications: { screen: tabNavScreen } },
  { tabBarOptions: { activeTintColor: "#e91e63" } }
);
```

Flutter provides several specialized widgets for drawer and tab navigation:
* [TabController]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TabController-class.html)&mdash;Coordinates
  the tab selection between a TabBar and a TabBarView.
* [TabBar]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TabBar-class.html)&mdash;Displays
  a horizontal row of tabs.
* [Tab]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Tab-class.html)&mdash;Creates
  a material design TabBar tab.
* [TabBarView]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TabBarView-class.html)&mdash;Displays
  the widget that corresponds to the currently selected tab.


<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
TabController controller=TabController(length: 2, vsync: this);

TabBar(
  tabs: <Tab>[
    Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.person),),
    Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.email),),
  ],
  controller: controller,
),

```


A `TabController` is required to coordinate the tab selection between a `TabBar`
and a `TabBarView`. The `TabController` constructor `length` argument is the total
number of tabs. A `TickerProvider` is required to trigger the notification whenever
a frame triggers a state change. The `TickerProvider` is `vsync`. Pass the
`vsync: this` argument to the `TabController` constructor whenever you create
a new `TabController`.

The [TickerProvider]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/TickerProvider-class.html)
is an interface implemented by classes that can vend
[`Ticker`]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/Ticker-class.html)
objects. Tickers can be used by any object that must be notified whenever a
frame triggers, but they're most commonly used indirectly via an
[`AnimationController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).
`AnimationControllers` need a `TickerProvider` to obtain their `Ticker`.
If you are creating an AnimationController from a State, then you can use the
[`TickerProviderStateMixin`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/TickerProviderStateMixin-mixin.html)
or [`SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/SingleTickerProviderStateMixin-mixin.html)
classes to obtain a suitable `TickerProvider`.

The [`Scaffold`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)
widget wraps a new `TabBar` widget and creates two tabs. The `TabBarView` widget
is passed as the `body` parameter of the `Scaffold` widget. All screens
corresponding to the `TabBar` widget’s tabs are children to the `TabBarView`
widget along with the same `TabController`.


<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter

class _NavigationHomePageState extends State<NavigationHomePage> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  TabController controller=TabController(length: 2, vsync: this);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      bottomNavigationBar: Material (
        child: TabBar(
          tabs: <Tab> [
            Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.person),)
            Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.email),),
          ],
          controller: controller,
        ),
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
      body: TabBarView(
        children: <Widget> [
          home.homeScreen(),
          tabScreen.tabScreen()
        ],
        controller: controller,
      )
    );
  }
}
```

#### Drawer navigation

In React Native, import the needed react-navigation packages and then use
`createDrawerNavigator` and `DrawerNavigation`.

```js
// React Native
export default (MyApp1 = DrawerNavigator({
  Home: {
    screen: SimpleApp
  },
  Screen2: {
    screen: drawerScreen
  }
}));
```

In Flutter, we can use the `Drawer` widget in combination with a `Scaffold` to
create a layout with a Material Design drawer. To add a `Drawer` to an app,
wrap it in a `Scaffold` widget. The `Scaffold` widget provides a consistent
visual structure to apps that follow the
[Material Design]({{site.material}}/design) guidelines. It also supports
special Material Design components, such as `Drawers`, `AppBars`, and `SnackBars`.

The `Drawer` widget is a Material Design panel that slides in horizontally from
the edge of a `Scaffold` to show navigation links in an application. You can
provide a [`Button`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/RaisedButton-class.html),
a [`Text`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) widget,
or a list of items to display as the child to the `Drawer` widget.
In the following example, the
[`ListTile`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html)
widget provides the navigation on tap.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
Drawer(
  child:ListTile(
    leading: Icon(Icons.change_history),
    title: Text('Screen2'),
    onTap: () {
      Navigator.of(context).pushNamed("/b");
    },
  ),
  elevation: 20.0,
),
```

The `Scaffold` widget also includes an `AppBar` widget that automatically
displays an appropriate IconButton to show the `Drawer` when a Drawer is
available in the `Scaffold`. The `Scaffold` automatically handles the
edge-swipe gesture to show the `Drawer`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    drawer: Drawer(
      child: ListTile(
        leading: Icon(Icons.change_history),
        title: Text('Screen2'),
        onTap: () {
          Navigator.of(context).pushNamed("/b");
        },
      ),
      elevation: 20.0,
    ),
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text("Home"),
    ),
    body: Container(),
  );
}
```

## Gesture detection and touch event handling

To listen for and respond to gestures, Flutter supports taps, drags, and
scaling. The gesture system in Flutter has two separate layers. The first layer
includes raw pointer events, which describe the location and movement of
pointers, (such as touches, mice, and styli movements), across the screen. The
second layer includes gestures, which describe semantic actions that consist of
one or more pointer movements.

### How do I add a click or press listeners to a widget?

In React Native, listeners are added to components using `PanResponder` or
the `Touchable` components.

```js
// React Native
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() => {
    console.log("Press");
  }}
  onLongPress={() => {
    console.log("Long Press");
  }}
>
  <Text>Tap or Long Press</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

For more complex gestures and combining several touches into a single gesture,
[`PanResponder`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html)
is used.

```js
// React Native
class App extends Component {

  componentWillMount() {
    this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (event, gestureState) =>
        !!getDirection(gestureState),
      onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => true,
      onPanResponderRelease: (event, gestureState) => {
        const drag = getDirection(gestureState);
      },
      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (event, gestureState) => true
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container} {...this._panResponder.panHandlers}>
        <View style={styles.center}>
          <Text>Swipe Horizontally or Vertically</Text>
        </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In Flutter, to add a click (or press) listener to a widget, use a button
or a touchable widget that has an `onPress: field`. Or, add gesture detection
to any widget by wrapping it in a
[`GestureDetector`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html).

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
GestureDetector(
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text("Gestures"),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Text('Tap, Long Press, Swipe Horizontally or Vertically '),
        ],
      )
    ),
  ),
  onTap: () {
    print('Tapped');
  },
  onLongPress: () {
    print('Long Pressed');
  },
  onVerticalDragEnd: (DragEndDetails value) {
    print('Swiped Vertically');
  },
  onHorizontalDragEnd: (DragEndDetails value) {
    print('Swiped Horizontally');
  },
);
```
For more information, including a list of Flutter `GestureDetector` callbacks,
see the [GestureDetector class][].

## Making HTTP network requests

Fetching data from the internet is common for most apps. And in Flutter,
the `http` package provides the simplest way to fetch data from the internet.

### How do I fetch data from API calls?

React Native provides the Fetch API for networking—you make a fetch request
and then receive the response to get the data.

```js
// React Native
_getIPAddress = () => {
  fetch("https://httpbin.org/ip")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(responseJson => {
      this.setState({ _ipAddress: responseJson.origin });
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
};
```

Flutter uses the `http` package. To install the `http` package, add it to
the dependencies section of our pubspec.yaml.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: <latest_version>
```

Flutter uses the
[`dart:io`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-io/dart-io-library.html)
core HTTP support client. To create an HTTP Client, import `dart:io`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
import 'dart:io';
```

The client supports the following HTTP operations: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
final url = Uri.https('httpbin.org', 'ip');
final httpClient = HttpClient();
_getIPAddress() async {
  var request = await httpClient.getUrl(url);
  var response = await request.close();
  var responseBody = await response.transform(utf8.decoder).join();
  String ip = json.decode(responseBody)['origin'];
  setState(() {
    _ipAddress = ip;
  });
}
```

## Form input

Text fields allow users to type text into your app so they can be used to build
forms, messaging apps, search experiences, and more. Flutter provides two
core text field widgets:
[TextField]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) and
[TextFormField]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html).

### How do I use text field widgets?

In React Native, to enter text you use a `TextInput` component to show a text
input box and then use the callback to store the value in a variable.

```js
// React Native
<TextInput
  placeholder="Enter your Password"
  onChangeText={password => this.setState({ password })}
 />
<Button title="Submit" onPress={this.validate} />
```

In Flutter, use the
[`TextEditingController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html)
class to manage a `TextField` widget. Whenever the text field is modified,
the controller notifies its listeners.

Listeners read the text and selection properties to learn what the user typed
into the field. You can access the text in `TextField` by the `text` property of
the controller.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
      ...
TextField(
  controller: _controller,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    hintText: 'Type something', labelText: "Text Field "
  ),
),
RaisedButton(
  child: Text('Submit'),
  onPressed: () {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
        child: AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Alert'),
          content: Text('You typed ${_controller.text}'),
        ),
     );
   },
 ),
)
```

In this example, when a user clicks on the submit button an alert dialog
displays the current text entered in the text field. This is achieved using an
[`alertDialog`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html)
widget that displays the alert message, and the text from
the `TextField` is accessed by the `text` property of the
[TextEditingController]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html).

### How do I use Form widgets?

In Flutter, use the
[`Form`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html)
widget where
[`TextFormField`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html)
widgets along with the submit button are passed as children.
The `TextFormField` widget has a parameter called
[`onSaved`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/FormField/onSaved.html)
which takes a callback and executes when the form is saved. A `FormState`
object is used to save, reset, or validate
each `FormField` that is a descendant of this `Form`. To obtain the `FormState`,
you can use  `Form.of` with a context whose ancestor is the Form, or pass a
`GlobalKey` to the Form constructor and call `GlobalKey.currentState`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
final formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

...

Form(
  key:formKey,
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      TextFormField(
        validator: (value) => !value.contains('@') ? 'Not a valid email.' : null,
        onSaved: (val) => _email = val,
        decoration: const InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Enter your email',
          labelText: 'Email',
        ),
      ),
      RaisedButton(
        onPressed: _submit,
        child: Text('Login'),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

The following example shows how `Form.save()` and `formKey` (which is a
`GlobalKey`) are used to save the form on submit.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
void _submit() {
  final form = formKey.currentState;
  if (form.validate()) {
    form.save();
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      child: AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Alert'),
        content: Text('Email: $_email, password: $_password'),
      )
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-specific code

When building a cross-platform app, you want to re-use as much code as
possible across platforms. However, scenarios may arise where it makes sense for
the code to be different depending on the OS. This requires a separate
implementation by declaring a specific platform.

In React Native, the following implementation would be used:

```js
// React Native
if (Platform.OS === "ios") {
  return "iOS";
} else if (Platform.OS === "android") {
  return "android";
} else {
  return "not recognised";
}
```
In Flutter, use the following implementation:
<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Flutter
if (Theme.of(context).platform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
  return "iOS";
} else if (Theme.of(context).platform == TargetPlatform.android) {
  return "android";
} else if (Theme.of(context).platform == TargetPlatform.fuchsia) {
  return "fuchsia";
} else {
  return "not recognised ";
}
```

## Debugging

Before running your applications, verify your code with `flutter analyze`. The
Flutter analyzer (which is a wrapper around the `dartanalyzer` tool) examines
your code and helps identify possible issues. If you’re using a Flutter-enabled
IDE, this occurs automatically.

### How do I access the in-app developer menu?

In React Native, the developer menu can be accessed by shaking your device: ⌘D
for the iOS Simulator or ⌘M for Android emulator.

In Flutter, if you are using an IDE, you can use the IDE tools. If you start
your application using `flutter run` you can also access the menu by typing `h`
in the terminal window, or type the following shortcuts:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">
| Action| Terminal Shortcut| Debug functions and properties|
| :------- | :------: | :------ |
| Widget hierarchy of the app| `w`| debugDumpApp()|
| Rendering tree of the app | `t`| debugDumpRenderTree()|
| Layers| `L`| debugDumpLayerTree()|
| Accessibility | `S` (traversal order) or<br>`U` (inverse hit test order)|debugDumpSemantics()|
| To toggle the widget inspector | `i` | WidgetsApp. showWidgetInspectorOverride|
| To toggle the display of construction lines| `p` | debugPaintSizeEnabled|
| To simulate different operating systems| `o` | defaultTargetPlatform|
| To display the performance overlay | `P` | WidgetsApp. showPerformanceOverlay|
| To save a screenshot to flutter. png| `s` ||
| To quit| `q` ||
{:.table.table-striped}
</div>

### How do I perform a hot reload?

Flutter’s hot reload feature helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs,
add features, and fix bugs. Instead of recompiling your app every time you make
a change, you can hot reload your app instantly. The app is updated to reflect
your change, and the current state of the app is preserved.

In React Native, the shortcut is ⌘R for the iOS Simulator and tapping R twice on
Android emulators.

In Flutter, If you are using IntelliJ IDE or Android Studio, you can select Save
All (⌘s/ctrl-s), or you can click the Hot Reload button on the toolbar. If you
are running the app at the command line using `flutter run`, type `r` in the
Terminal window. You can also perform a full restart by typing `R` in the
Terminal window.

### What tools can I use to debug my app in Flutter?

There are several options and tools you can use when you need to debug your
Flutter app.

In addition to the Flutter analyzer, the
[`Dart Observatory`](https://dart-lang.github.io/observatory/) is a tool used to
profile and debug your Dart applications. If you started your application using
`flutter run` in Terminal, you can open the web page at the Observatory URL
printed to the terminal window, for example:  `http://127.0.0.1:8100/`.

The Observatory includes support for profiling, examining the heap, observing
executed lines of code, debugging memory leaks and memory fragmentation. For
more information, see the
[Observatory documentation](https://dart-lang.github.io/observatory/).
Observatory is included for free when you download and install the Dart SDK.

If you're using an IDE, you can debug your application using the IDE debugger.

If you're using IntelliJ and Android Studio, you can use the Flutter Inspector.
 The Flutter Inspector makes it much easier to understand why your application
  is rendering the way it does. It allows you to:
* View the UI structure of your app as a tree of widgets
* Select a point on your device or simulator and find the corresponding widget
 that rendered those pixels
* View properties for individual widgets
* Quickly identify layout issues and determine their cause

The Flutter Inspector view can be opened from View > Tool Windows > Flutter
Inspector. Content is shown only when an app is running.

To inspect a specific widget, select the **Toggle inspect mode** action in the
toolbar, then click on the desired widget on an attached phone or simulator. The
widget is highlighted in your app’s UI. You’ll see the widget in the widget
hierarchy in IntelliJ and the individual properties for that widget.

For more information, see
[Debugging Flutter Apps](/docs/testing/debugging).

## Animation

Well-designed animation makes a UI feel intuitive, contributes to the look and
feel of a polished app, and improves the user experience. Flutter’s animation
support makes it easy to implement simple and complex animations. The Flutter
SDK includes many Material Design widgets that include standard
motion effects and you can easily customize these effects to personalize your
app.

In React Native, Animated APIs are used to create animations.

In Flutter, use the
[`Animation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
class and the
[`AnimationController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
class.  `Animation` is an abstract class that understands its current value and
its state (completed or dismissed). The `AnimationController` class lets you
play an animation forward or in reverse, or stop animation and set the animation
to a specific value to customize the motion.

### How do I add a simple fade-in animation?

In the React Native example below, an animated component, `FadeInView` is
created using the Animated API. The initial opacity state, final state, and the
duration over which the transition occurs are defined. The animation component
is added inside the `Animated` component, the opacity state `fadeAnim` is mapped
to the opacity of the Text component that we want to animate, and then,
`start()` is called to start the animation.

```js
// React Native
class FadeInView extends React.Component {
  state = {
    fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0) // Initial value for opacity: 0
  };
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.timing(this.state.fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 10000
    }).start();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Animated.View style={%raw%}{{...this.props.style, opacity: this.state.fadeAnim }}{%endraw%} >
        {this.props.children}
      </Animated.View>
    );
  }
}
    ...
<FadeInView>
  <Text> Fading in </Text>
</FadeInView>
    ...
```

To create the same animation in Flutter, create an
[`AnimationController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
object named `controller` and specify the duration. By default, an
`AnimationController` linearly produces values that range from 0.0 to 1.0,
during a given duration. The animation controller generates a new value
whenever the device running your app is ready to display a new frame.
Typically, this rate is around 60 values per second.

When defining an `AnimationController`, you must pass in a `vsync` object. The
presence of `vsync` prevents offscreen animations from consuming unnecessary
resources. You can use your stateful object as the `vsync` by adding
`TickerProviderStateMixin` to the class definition. An `AnimationController`
needs a TickerProvider, which is configured using the `vsync` argument on the
constructor.

A [`Tween`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html)
describes the interpolation between a beginning and ending value
or the mapping from an input range to an output range. To use a `Tween` object
with an animation, call the `Tween` object's `animate` method and pass it the
`Animation` object that you want to modify.

For this example, a
[`FadeTransition`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/FadeTransition-class.html)
widget is used and the `opacity` property is mapped to the `animation` object.

To start the animation, use `controller.forward()`. Other operations can also be
performed using the controller such as `fling()` or `repeat()`. For this
example, the
[`FlutterLogo`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/FlutterLogo-class.html)
widget is used inside the `FadeTransition` widget.

<!-- skip -->
```dart

// Flutter
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(Center(child: LogoFade()));
}

class LogoFade extends StatefulWidget {
  _LogoFadeState createState() => _LogoFadeState();
}

class _LogoFadeState extends State<LogoFade> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  Animation animation;
  AnimationController controller;

  initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller = AnimationController(
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 3000), vsync: this);
    final CurvedAnimation curve =
    CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
    animation = Tween(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0).animate(curve);
    controller.forward();
  }

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FadeTransition(
      opacity: animation,
      child: Container(
        height: 300.0,
        width: 300.0,
        child: FlutterLogo(),
      ),
    );
  }

  dispose() {
    controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

### How do I add swipe animation to cards?

In React Native, either the `PanResponder` or third-party libraries are used for
swipe animation.

In Flutter, to add a swipe animation, use the
[`Dismissible`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Dismissible-class.html)
widget and nest the child widgets.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
child: Dismissible(
  key: key,
  onDismissed: (DismissDirection dir) {
    cards.removeLast();
  },
  child: Container(
    ...
  ),
),
```
