## How did it all start?

## Dash 的由来？

As soon as Shams Zakhour started working as a
Dart writer at Google in December 2013,
she started advocating for a Dart mascot.
After documenting Java for 14 years, she
had observed how beloved the Java mascot,
[Duke][], had become,
and she wanted something similar for Dart.

Shams Zakhour 从 2013 年 12 月
在 Google 担任 Dart 作者的职务开始，
她就一直在倡导推进 Dart 的吉祥物。
在为 Java 撰写了 14 年的文档后，
她发现 Java 的吉祥物 [Duke][] 十分受欢迎，
从而希望让 Dart 也拥有类似的东西。

But the idea didn't gain momentum until 2017,
when one of the Flutter engineers, Nina Chen,
suggested it on an internal mailing list.
The Flutter VP at the time, Joshy Joseph,
approved the idea and asked the
organizer for the [2018 Dart Conference][],
Linda Rasmussen, to make it happen.

但这个想法直到 2017 年一位 Flutter 工程师 Nina Chen
在内部邮件中再次提出，才取得了实质性的进展。
时任副总裁 Joshy Joseph 批准了这个想法，
并且让 [2018 年度 Dart 会议][2018 Dart Conference]
的组织者 Linda Rasmussen 进行落地。

Once Shams heard about these plans,
she rushed to Linda and asked to own and drive
the project to produce the plushies for the conference.
Linda had already elicited some design sketches,
which she handed off.
Starting with the sketches, Shams located a vendor
who could work within an aggressive deadline
(competing with Lunar New Year),
and started the process of creating
the specs for the plushy.

Shams 在知晓这个计划后，立刻找到了 Linda，
希望主导并推进这个项目，计划生产一些毛绒玩具。
Linda 早前已经设计出了一些草图，她将这些草图移交给了 Shams。
有了这些草图后，Shams 找到了一家可以在截止日期前（赶在农历新年之前）
合作的供应商，接着便开始制作毛绒玩具的规格。

That's right, Dash was originally a
**Dart** mascot, not a Flutter mascot.

是的，Dash 最初是 **Dart** 的吉祥物，而不是 Flutter 的。

Here are some early mockups and one of the first prototypes:

以下是最初的原型和一些早期的模型：

## Why a hummingbird?

## 为什么是一只蜂鸟？

Early on, a hummingbird image was created for the Dart team
to use for presentations and the web.
The hummingbird represents that Dart is a speedy language.

最初，蜂鸟用来作为展示和网页用途。使用蜂鸟代表 Dart 是一门速度极快的语言。

![Early hummingbird drawing](/assets/images/dash/DartHummingbird.jpg){:width="35%"}<br>

However, hummingbirds are pointed and angular
and we wanted a cuddly plushy, so we chose a round
hummingbird.

然而，又尖又有棱有角的蜂鸟无法作为毛茸茸的可爱玩具，
所以我们最终选择了圆润的蜂鸟。

Shams specified which color would go where,
the tail shape, the tuft of hair, the eyes...all the
little details. The vendor sent the specs to two
manufacturers who returned the prototypes some weeks later.

Shams 为 Dash 指定了颜色的应用范围、尾巴的形状、一小簇头发、眼睛以及其他小细节。
供应商将这些细则发给两个制造商后，他们在几周后送回了毛绒玩具的原型。

While the manufacturing process was proceeding,
Shams chose a name for the plushy: Dash,
because it was an early code name for the
Dart project, it was gender neutral,
and it seemed appropriate for a hummingbird.

在制造商推进制作的同时，Shams 毛绒玩具取了个名字：Dash，
它其实是 Dart 项目的早期代号，而且不分性别，
似乎更适合作为一只蜂鸟的名字。

Many boxes of Dash plushies arrived in
southern California just in time for the conference.
They were eagerly adopted by Dart _and_ Flutter enthusiasts.

许多箱 Dash 毛绒玩具赶在会议开始前送到了南加州。
它们受到了大量 **Dart 和 Flutter** 爱好者的喜爱。

The people have spoken,
so Dash is now the mascot for Flutter **and** Dart.

Flutter 和 Dart 的演讲者都携带着 Dash 进行了演讲，
所以 Dash 就成为了 **Flutter 和 Dart** 的吉祥物。

Since the creation of Dash 1.0, we've made two more versions.
Marketing slightly changed the Dart and Flutter color scheme after
Dash 1.0 was created, so Dash 2.0 reflects the updated scheme
(which removed the green color).
Dash 2.1 is a smaller size and has a few more color
tweaks. The smaller size is easier to ship,
and fits better in a claw machine!

自 Dash 1.0 之后，我们又制作了两个版本的 Dash。
市场部门针对 Dash 1.0 微调了 Dart 和 Flutter 的配色方案，
Dash 2.0 对应了更新后的配色方案（移除了绿色）。
Dash 2.1 尺寸更小，并且调整了更多配色。
小尺寸的 Dash 更易运输，并且更适合放在娃娃机中！
