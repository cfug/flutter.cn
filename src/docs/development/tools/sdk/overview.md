The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop
Flutter apps across platforms. To get the Flutter SDK, see [Install][].

## What's in the Flutter SDK

The following is available through the Flutter SDK:

* [Dart SDK][]
* Heavily optimized, mobile-first 2D rendering engine with
  excellent support for text
* Modern react-style framework
* Rich set of widgets implementing Material Design and iOS styles
* APIs for unit and integration tests
* Interop and plugin APIs to connect to the system and 3rd-party SDKs
* Headless test runner for running tests on Windows, Linux, and Mac
* [Dart DevTools][] for testing, debugging, and profiling your app
* `flutter` and `dart` command-line tools for creating, building, testing,
  and compiling your apps

Note: For more information about the Flutter SDK, see its
[README file][].

## `flutter` command-line tool

The [`flutter` CLI tool][] (`flutter/bin/flutter`) is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter.

## `dart` command-line tool

The [`dart` CLI tool][] is available with the Flutter SDK at `flutter/bin/dart`.
