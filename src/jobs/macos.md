## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit, with support
for desktop, mobile, and web applications. The team is constantly
looking to improve integration, performance, and fidelity for each
native platform. We’re seeking software engineers who have the skills
and experience to help us with all that on the macOS platform.

The Flutter Desktop Team is responsible for the desktop-specific
(Windows, macOS, Linux) embeddings of the Flutter engine, which
includes enabling platform plugins, nesting platform views inside
Flutter apps, and wiring-up accessibility hooks on those platforms –
and anything else that helps Flutter feel “native” when run in those
environments.

## About the position

In the "macOS Engineer" role you'll be part of the team that makes
Flutter apps the absolute best they can be when running on macOS, including:

*   Designing and building multi-window support.
*   Building support for macOS system menu integration.
*   Integrating Flutter with system services like accessibility,
    file selection, printing, clipboard, drag and drop.
*   Adding support for nesting macOS UI views inside Flutter apps.
*   Delivering outstanding performance on macOS.
*   Nurturing a thriving community of contributions from open-source
    developers by reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Our values

### Mentorship

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t
