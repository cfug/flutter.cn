Flutter apps can include both code and _assets_ (sometimes called
resources). An asset is a file that is bundled and deployed with your
app, and is accessible at runtime. Common types of assets include
static data (for example, JSON files), configuration files, icons, and
images (JPEG, WebP, GIF, animated WebP/GIF, PNG, BMP, and WBMP).

## Specifying assets

Flutter uses
the [`pubspec.yaml`]({{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/pubspec) file,
located at the root of your project, to identify assets required by an
app.

Here is an example:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/my_icon.png
    - assets/background.png
```

To include all assets under a directory, specify the directory name with
the `/` character at the end:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
```

Note that only files located directly in the directory will be
included; to add files located in subdirectories, create an entry per
directory.

### Asset bundling

The `assets` subsection of the `flutter` section specifies files that
should be included with the app. Each asset is identified by an
explicit path (relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file) where the asset
file is located. The order in which the assets are declared does not
matter. The actual directory used (`assets` in this case) does not
matter.

During a build, Flutter places assets into a special archive called
the _asset bundle_, which apps can read from at runtime.

### Asset variants

The build process supports the notion of asset variants: different
versions of an asset that might be displayed in different contexts.
When an asset's path is specified in the `assets` section of
`pubspec.yaml`, the build process looks for any files with the same
name in adjacent subdirectories. Such files are then included in the
asset bundle along with the specified asset.

For example, if you have the following files in your application
directory:

```
  .../pubspec.yaml
  .../graphics/my_icon.png
  .../graphics/background.png
  .../graphics/dark/background.png
  ...etc.
```

...and your `pubspec.yaml` file contains:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - graphics/background.png
```

...then both `graphics/background.png` and `graphics/dark/background.png`
will be included in your asset bundle. The former is considered the
_main asset_, while the latter is considered a _variant_.

If on the other hand the graphics directory is specified:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - graphics/
```

... then `graphics/my_icon.png`, `graphics/background.png` and `graphics/dark/background.png` will be included.

Flutter uses asset variants when choosing resolution appropriate
images; see below. In the future, this mechanism may be extended to
include variants for different locales or regions, reading directions,
etc.

## Loading assets

Your app can access its assets through an
[`AssetBundle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html)
object.

The two main methods on an asset bundle allow you to load a
string/text asset (`loadString`) or an image/binary asset (`load`) out
of the bundle, given a logical key. The logical key maps to the path
to the asset specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file at build time.

### Loading text assets

Each Flutter app has a
[`rootBundle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/services/rootBundle.html)
object for easy access to the main asset bundle. It is possible to
load assets directly using the `rootBundle` global static from
`package:flutter/services.dart`.

However, it's recommended to obtain the AssetBundle for the current
BuildContext using
[`DefaultAssetBundle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/DefaultAssetBundle-class.html).
Rather than the default asset bundle that was built with the app, this
approach enables a parent widget to substitute a different AssetBundle
at run time, which can be useful for localization or testing
scenarios.

Typically, you'll use `DefaultAssetBundle.of()` to indirectly load an
asset, for example a JSON file, from the app's runtime `rootBundle`.

  BuildContext using DefaultAssetBundle.of
{% endcomment %}

Outside of a Widget context, or when a handle to an AssetBundle is not
available, you can use `rootBundle` to directly load such assets,
for example:

```dart
import 'dart:async' show Future;
import 'package:flutter/services.dart' show rootBundle;

Future<String> loadAsset() async {
  return await rootBundle.loadString('assets/config.json');
}
```

### Loading images

Flutter can load resolution-appropriate images for the current device
pixel ratio.

#### Declaring resolution-aware image assets {#resolution-aware}

[`AssetImage`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/AssetImage-class.html)
understands how to map a logical requested asset onto one that most
closely matches the current [device pixel ratio]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Window/devicePixelRatio.html).
In order for this mapping to
work, assets should be arranged according to a particular directory structure:

```
  .../image.png
  .../Mx/image.png
  .../Nx/image.png
  ...etc.
```

...where _M_ and _N_ are numeric identifiers that correspond to the nominal resolution
of the images contained within, in other words, they specify the device pixel ratio that
the images are intended for.

The main asset is assumed to correspond to a
resolution of 1.0. For example, consider the following asset layout for an
image named `my_icon.png`:

```
  .../my_icon.png
  .../2.0x/my_icon.png
  .../3.0x/my_icon.png
```

On devices with a device pixel ratio of 1.8, the asset `.../2.0x/my_icon.png`
would be chosen. For a device pixel ratio of 2.7, the asset
`.../3.0x/my_icon.png` would be chosen.

If the width and height of the rendered image are not specified on the `Image` widget, the nominal
resolution is used to scale the asset so that it will occupy the same amount
of screen space as the main asset would have, just with a higher resolution.
That is, if `.../my_icon.png` is 72px by 72px, then `.../3.0x/my_icon.png`
should be 216px by 216px; but they both will render into 72px by 72px
(in logical pixels) if width and height are not specified.

Each entry in the asset section of the `pubspec.yaml` should correspond to a real file, with the
exception of the main asset entry. If the main asset entry does not correspond
to a real file, then the asset with the lowest resolution will be used as the fallback
for devices with device pixel ratios below that resolution. The entry should still
be included in the `pubspec.yaml` manifest, however.

#### Loading images

To load an image, use the
[`AssetImage`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/AssetImage-class.html)
class in a widget's `build` method.

For example, your app can load the background image from the asset
declarations above:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // ...
  return DecoratedBox(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      image: DecorationImage(
        image: AssetImage('graphics/background.png'),
        // ...
      ),
      // ...
    ),
  );
  // ...
}
```

Anything using the default asset bundle will inherit resolution
awareness when loading images. (If you work with some of the lower
level classes, like
[`ImageStream`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/ImageStream-class.html)
or
[`ImageCache`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/ImageCache-class.html),
you'll also notice parameters related to scale.)

### Asset images in package dependencies {#from-packages}

To load an image from a [package](/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages) dependency,
the `package` argument must be provided to [`AssetImage`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/AssetImage-class.html).

For instance, suppose your application depends on a package called `my_icons`, which has the following directory structure:

```
  .../pubspec.yaml
  .../icons/heart.png
  .../icons/1.5x/heart.png
  .../icons/2.0x/heart.png
  ...etc.
```

Then to load the image, use:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
 AssetImage('icons/heart.png', package: 'my_icons')
```

Assets used by the package itself should also be fetched using the `package` argument as above.

#### Bundling of package assets

If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file of the package, it is bundled automatically with the application. In particular, assets used by the package itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.

A package can also choose to have assets in its `lib/` folder that are not specified in its `pubspec.yaml` file. In this case, for those images to be bundled, the application has to specify which ones to include in its `pubspec.yaml`. For instance, a package named `fancy_backgrounds` could have the following files:

```
  .../lib/backgrounds/background1.png
  .../lib/backgrounds/background2.png
  .../lib/backgrounds/background3.png
```

To include, say, the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the application should specify it in the `assets` section:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
```

The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.

## Sharing assets with the underlying platform

Flutter assets are readily available to platform code via AssetManager on Android and NSBundle on iOS.

### Android

On Android the assets are available via the [AssetManager API]({{site.android-dev}}/reference/android/content/res/AssetManager).
The lookup key used in for instance [openFd]({{site.android-dev}}/reference/android/content/res/AssetManager#openFd(java.lang.String)) is obtained from
`lookupKeyForAsset` on [PluginRegistry.Registrar]({{site.api}}/javadoc/io/flutter/plugin/common/PluginRegistry.Registrar.html) or `getLookupKeyForAsset` on
[FlutterView]({{site.api}}/javadoc/io/flutter/view/FlutterView.html).
`PluginRegistry.Registrar` is available when developing a plugin while `FlutterView` would be the choice when developing an
app including a platform view.

As an example, suppose you have specified this in your pubspec.yaml

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - icons/heart.png
```

reflecting the following structure in your Flutter app.

```
  .../pubspec.yaml
  .../icons/heart.png
  ...etc.
```

To access `icons/heart.png` from your Java plugin code you would do;

```java
AssetManager assetManager = registrar.context().getAssets();
String key = registrar.lookupKeyForAsset("icons/heart.png");
AssetFileDescriptor fd = assetManager.openFd(key);
```

### iOS

On iOS the assets are available via the [mainBundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsbundle/1410786-mainbundle).
The lookup key used in for instance [pathForResource:ofType:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsbundle/1410989-pathforresource) is obtained from
`lookupKeyForAsset` or `lookupKeyForAsset:fromPackage:` on [FlutterPluginRegistrar]({{site.api}}/objcdoc/Protocols/FlutterPluginRegistrar.html) or `lookupKeyForAsset:` or
`lookupKeyForAsset:fromPackage:` on [FlutterViewController]({{site.api}}/objcdoc/Classes/FlutterViewController.html).
`FlutterPluginRegistrar` is available when developing
a plugin while `FlutterViewController` would be the choice when developing an app including a platform view.

As an example, suppose you have the Flutter setting from above.

To access `icons/heart.png` from your Objective-C plugin code you would do;

```objective-c
NSString* key = [registrar lookupKeyForAsset:@"icons/heart.png"];
NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:key ofType:nil];
```

For a more complete example see the implementation of the Flutter
[video_player plugin]({{site.pub}}/packages/video_player).

## Platform assets

There will also be occasions to work with assets in the platform projects directly.
Below are two common cases where assets are used before the Flutter framework is loaded and running.

### Updating the app icon

Updating your Flutter application's launch icon works the same way as updating launch icons in
native Android or iOS applications.

![Launch icon](/images/assets-and-images/icon.png)

#### Android

In your Flutter project's root directory, navigate to `.../android/app/src/main/res`.
The various bitmap resource folders such as `mipmap-hdpi` already contain placeholder images named
`ic_launcher.png`. Simply replace them with your desired assets respecting the recommended icon size
per screen density as indicated by the [Android Developer
Guide]({{site.android-dev}}/training/multiscreen/screendensities).

![Android icon location](/images/assets-and-images/android-icon-path.png)

{{site.alert.note}}
  If you rename the .png files, you must also match the new name in your
  `AndroidManifest.xml`'s `<application>` tag's `android:icon` attribute.
{{site.alert.end}}

#### iOS

In your Flutter project's root directory, navigate to `.../ios/Runner`. The directory `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` already contains placeholder images. Simply replace them with the appropriately sized images as indicated by their filename as dictated by the Apple [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon). Keep the original file names.

![iOS icon location](/images/assets-and-images/ios-icon-path.png)

### Updating the launch screen

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/assets-and-images/launch-screen.png" alt="Launch screen" />
</p>

Flutter also uses native platform mechanisms to draw transitional launch screens to your Flutter app while the Flutter framework loads. This launch screen will persist until Flutter renders the first frame of your application.

{{site.alert.note}}
  This implies that if you don't call
  [runApp()]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/runApp.html) in the
  `main()` function of your app (or more specifically, if you don't call
  [`window.render()`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Window/render.html)
  in response to
  [`window.onDrawFrame`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Window/onDrawFrame.html)),
  the launch screen will persist forever.
{{site.alert.end}}

#### Android

To add a "splash screen" to your Flutter application, navigate to `.../android/app/src/main`. In `res/drawable/launch_background.xml`, You can use this [layer list drawable]({{site.android-dev}}/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource#LayerList) XML to customize the look of your launch screen. The existing template provides an example for adding a image to to the middle of a white splash screen in commented code. You can uncomment it or use other [drawables]({{site.android-dev}}/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource) to achieve the intended effect.

#### iOS

To add an image to the center of your "splash screen", navigate to `.../ios/Runner`. In, `Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset`, drop in images named `LaunchImage.png`, `LaunchImage@2x.png`, `LaunchImage@3x.png`. If you use different filenames, you'll also have to update the `Contents.json` file in the same directory.

You can also fully customize your launch screen storyboard in Xcode by opening `.../ios/Runner.xcworkspace`. Navigate to `Runner/Runner` in the Project Navigator and drop in images by opening `Assets.xcassets` or do any customization using the Interface Builder in `LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
