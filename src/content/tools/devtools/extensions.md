## What are DevTools extensions?

[DevTools extensions](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools_extensions)
are developer tools provided by third-party packages that are
tightly integrated into the DevTools tooling suite.
Extensions are distributed as part of a pub package,
and they are dynamically loaded into DevTools when
a user is debugging their app.

## Use a DevTools extension

If your app depends on a package that provides a DevTools extension,
the extension automatically shows up in a new tab when you open DevTools.

### Configure extension enablement states

You need to manually enable the extension before it loads for the first time.
Make sure the extension is provided by a source you trust before enabling it.

Extension enablement states are stored in a `devtools_options.yaml`
file in the root of the user's project
(similar to `analysis_options.yaml`).
This file stores per-project
(or optionally, per user) settings for DevTools.

If this file is **checked into source control**, the specified options are
configured for the project. This means that anyone who pulls a project's
source code and works on the project uses the same settings.

If this file is **omitted from source control**, for example by adding
`devtools_options.yaml` as an entry in the `.gitignore` file, then the specified
options are configured separately for each user. Since each user or
contributor to the project uses a local copy of the `devtools_options.yaml`
file in this case, the specified options might differ between project contributors.
