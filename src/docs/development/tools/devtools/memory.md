## What is it?

Allocated Dart objects created using a class constructor (for
example, by using `new MyClass()` or `MyClass()`) live in a
portion of memory called the heap. The memory in the heap is
managed by the Dart VM (virtual machine).

## DevTools memory page

DevTools Memory page lets you peek at how an isolate is using
memory at a given moment. 

Memory profiling in DevTools consists of 3 main functions:
* Charting memory usage statistics and events
* Anaylsis to view all memory via a heap to detect memory issues and inspect objects
* Allocations to monitor and track (stack trace) specific classes and objects when an allocation occurs

## Charting memory statistics and events

At the top-level, when the memory tab is selected memory statistics from
the VM are collected. These statistics are displayed in the two overview
charts (Dart memory and Android-only) the collection of general memory
usage e.g., total heap used, external heap, maximum heap capacity,
Resident Set Size (RSS). As you interact with your application various
events are detected e.g., memory GC (garabage collection),Flutter events,
user fired events (using the ```dart:developer``` package) are collected
in the same timeline as the memory statistics. All of this collected
statistics and events are displayed in charts see [Memory anatomy](#memory-anatomy).

## Analysis and snapshots

A Snapshot is a complete, the most complex and time consuming view of
all objects in the Dart memory heap. Each time a snapshot is taken, an
analysis is performed over the collected memory data.  The analysis
attempts to identify any memory patterns that may cause leaks or lead to
application crashes. For example, loading large assets for thumbnail-sized
images inefficiently, memory usage can be improved by loading smaller
assets or adjusting the cacheWidth/cacheHeight to decode an image to a
smaller size reducing the memory usage of the ImageCache. The analysis
catches issues like this see [Analysis tab](#analysis-tab).

## Allocations and tracking

Monitoring all allocations involes you directly interacting with DevTools
and your application to isolate a short period of time that you are
interested in knowing how many objects were allocated, how many bytes
were allocated, or tracking all the places in your code where a particular
class is allocated. This information is available under the "Allocations"
tab of Memory profiler and his a fairly fast with less overhead than using
a snapshot.

Monitoring allocations and resetting of accumulators, helps to analyze
the accumulator counts (number of objects or bytes allocated) in a short
timeframe between a reset and monitor Track events. The accumulators
can be used to understand the rate of memory allocations. If you suspect
your application is leaking memory or has other bugs relating to memory
allocation. Additionally, the ability to track a few specific classes, too
many may slow the running of your application. The VM records the stack
trace at the time a class' constructor (allocation) is called. This can
isolate the exact location in your code when/where memory is being allocated.
See [Allocation tab](#allocation-tab).

{{site.alert.note}}
  **Use [profile mode][] when running your app to analyze performance.**
  Memory usage is not indicative of release performance unless your
  application is run in profile mode. In general, memory usage is
  fairly accurate, in relative terms, between debug, release, or
  profile modes. Profile mode might show higher absolute memory usage
  because a service isolate is created to profile your application.
  This isolate won't exist in release mode. Absolute memory used might
  also be higher in debug versus release mode. In [release mode][],
  work can be computed and optimized ahead of time, while in [debug mode][]
  that same work might have to be computed at runtime,
  requiring more information.
{{site.alert.end}}

## Memory anatomy

A timeseries graph is used to visualize the state of the Flutter memory
at successive intervals of time. Each data point on the chart
corresponds to the timestamp (x-axis) of measured quantities (y-axis)
of the heap, for example, usage, capacity, external, garbage
collection, and resident set size.

### Events Pane

The event timeline displays Dart VM and DevTools events
on a shared timeline. These events can be snapshots (manual and auto),
Dart VM GCs, user requested GCs, or monitor and accumulator reset actions.

![Screenshot of DevTools events](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline.png)

This chart displays DevTools events (such as manual GC, VM GC,
Snapshot, monitor Allocations **Track** and **Reset** of accumulators button
clicks) in relation to the memory chart timeline. Clicking over the
markers in the Event timeline displays a hover card of the time when
the event occurred. This may help identify when a memory leak might have
occurred in the timeline (x-axis).

![Screenshot of the event timeline legend](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline_legend.png)

This legend shows the symbol for each DevTools event and its meaning

</dl>

Displayed below the events pane is the [memory chart](#memory-overview-chart)
and the [Android memory chart](#android-chart). The android-memory chart is
specific to an Android app, and it shows Android ADB meminfo from an
ADB app summary.

### Adding user custom events to the timeline

Sometimes it may be difficult to correlate the actions in your Flutter
application code and the collected memory statistics/events charted in
the Memory timeline/chart. To help know what's happening in your code
your own events can be injected into the Memory Profile timeline to
help to understand how your application's memory usage is performing
within the Dart/Flutter framework (heap).

Posting your own custom event(s) are done using the dart:developer package
postEvent method. In particular, the event name must be prefixed with
**DevTools.Event_** then your event name would be appended e.g.,
**DevTools.Event_**_MyEventName_

To use add the following import to your code:

```
import 'dart:developer' as developer;
```

and a method to post custom event(s) to the Memory timeline:
```
  void devToolsPostEvent(String eventName, Map<String, Object> eventData) {
    developer.postEvent('DevTools.Event_$eventName', eventData);
  }
```

Then to post an event from your code you would call the devToolsPostEvent
e.g. In your function recordLoadedImage you could cause the 'MyImages'
event to be posted to the Memory (event) timeline with the values method
and param (the URL).

```
  Widget recordLoadedImage(ImageChunkEvent imageChunkEvent, String imageUrl) {
 
    // Record the event in the memory event pane.
    devToolsPostEvent('MyFirstApp', { 'method': 'recordLoadedImage', 'param': imageUrl });

    if (imageChunkEvent == null) return null;

    ...

  }
```
Clicking on the aggregated event triangle in the event pane will dispay a
hover card with the details of all events e.g., two custom events at
the timestamp 04:36:21 with the event name 'MyFirstApp' and the two
eventData entries method and param are displayed with their values: 

![Hover Card Custom Events](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_hover_events.png)

Scrolling the events displays:

![Custom Events Details](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_events_detail.png)

## Memory overview chart

A timeseries graph of collected memory statistics, to visualize
the state of the Dart/Flutter heap and Dart/Flutter native memory
over time.

The chart's x-axis is a timeline of events (timeseries). The data
plotted in the y-axis all have a timestamp when the data was
collected. In other words, it shows the polled state (capacity,
used, external, RSS (resident set size), and GC (garbage collection))
of the memory every 500 ms. This helps give a live appearance on
the state of the memory as the application is running.

Clicking on the Legend button describes the collected measurements
and symbols/colors used to display the data.

![Screenshot of a memory anatomy page](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_chart_anatomy.png)

The **Memory Size Scale** Y axis scale automatically adjusts to the
range of data collected in the current visible chart range.

The quantities plotted on the y-axis are:

**Dart/Flutter Heap** Objects (Dart/Flutter objects) in the heap.

**Dart/Flutter Native** Memory that is not in the Dart/Flutter heap but
  is still part of the total memory footprint. Objects in this
  memory would be native objects (for example, from a memory read
  from a file, or a decoded image). The native objects are exposed
  to the Dart VM from the native OS (such as Android, Linux, Windows,
  iOS) using a Dart embedder. The embedder creates a Dart wrapper
  with a finalizer, allowing Dart code to communicate with these
  native resources. Flutter has an embedder for Android and iOS.
  For more information, see [Dart on the Server][server] or
  [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders][embedder].

**Timeline** The timestamps of all collected memory statistics
and events at a particular point in time (timestamp).

**Raster Cache** Size of the Flutter engine's raster cache layer(s)
or picture(s) while performing the final rendering after compositing.
See [Flutter Architectural Overview][architecture] and
[DevTools Performance][performance].

**Allocated** Current capacity of the heap is typically slightly
larger than total size of all heap objects.

**RSS - Resident Set Size** The resident set size displays the
amount of memory for a process. It doesn't include memory that is
swapped out. It includes memory from shared libraries that are
loaded, as well as all stack and heap memory.

For more information, see [Dart VM internals][vm].

### Hover card

Clicking in a chart will display a vertical yellow line where the click
occurred on the X-Axis (Timestamp), a hover card will be displayed with
the information collected:

![Screenshot of the basic memory chart](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_basic_chart.png)

**Memory Events** Memory Events recorded in the Event Pane e.g., VM GC,
User Initiated GC, User Initiated Snapshot, Auto-Snapshot,
Allocation Monitoring and, Reset of Accumulators.

**Dart / Flutter Memory**
Collected data Capacity, Used, External, RSS, Raster Cache
(pictures/layers).

**Flutter and User Events**
Extension events e.g., Flutter.ImageSizesForFrame, user
custom events see [Events](#events-pane).

Aggregate events, as the name implies, collects all the events nearest
a particular timestamp (tick) and displays the events to the x-axis'
closest tick.

If more than one event, collected at this timestamp, a dark magenta
triangle is displayed with the aggregate list of events. The aggregate
vents collects all the events nearest a particular timestamp (tick)
and displays the events to the X-Axis closest tick. Expanding the events
will display the values for each event:
![Aggregate Events](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_multi_events.png){:width="25px"}

If only one event is collected, a lighter magenta triangle color is
displayed with the single event values:
![Single Events](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_one_event.png){:width="23px"}

If the Android memory chart is displayed then the Android collect data
will displayed between the "Dart / Flutter Memory" and the "Flutter and
User Events" e.g.,

![Hovercard of Android chart is visible](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_android_hovercard.png)

### Android chart

When connected to an Android app, DevTools collects Android's ADB
(Android Debug Bridge) meminfo from an ADB app summary (polled every 500 ms).
This meminfo section is the most interesting at a high-level.  If you were
to collect this info from the ADB tool, this is what it would look like:
```
> adb shell dumpsys meminfo io.flutter.demo.gallery -d

 App Summary
                       Pss(KB)
                       -------
           Java Heap:     5192
         Native Heap:    11992
                Code:     2132
               Stack:       60
            Graphics:    53700
       Private Other:    42800
              System:    84493
 
               TOTAL:   200369       TOTAL SWAP PSS:    82168
```

This chart is another timeseries graph of the state of Android memory as
the application is running. The quantities plotted on the y-axis are
the above values (Java Heap, Native Heap, Code size, Stack size,
Graphics stack, System size and total).

Clicking on a timestamp (x-position) will display all data points
collected for that time period.

![Screenshot of Android Memory Chart](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_android.png)

The hover card will display the values of all collected Android memory data.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Time**</dt>
<dd>The timestamp for the current data values collected -
    see descriptions below.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Total**</dt>
<dd>The total memory in use. Total memory is comprised of
    several different categories, all of which are plotted
    along the y-axis. These categories are described below.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Other**</dt>
<dd>Other memory usage corresponds to the ‘Private Other’
    field from ADB. This is memory used by the app that the
    system isn't sure how to categorize. Note: The Other trace
    is a combination of Other and System (shared and system
    memory usage) - corresponds to ‘System’ field from ADB.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Code**</dt>
<dd>Code memory usage corresponds to the ‘Code’ field from ADB.
This is memory that your app uses for static code and resources,
such as dex byte code, optimized or compiled dex code, .so libraries,
and fonts.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Native Heap**</dt>
<dd>Native Heap usage corresponds to the ‘Native Heap’ field
    from ADB. This is memory from objects allocated from C or
    C++ code. Even if you're not using C++ in your app, you might
    see some native memory used here because the Android framework
    uses native memory to handle various tasks on your behalf. Some
    examples of these tasks are handling image assets and other
    graphics—even though the code you've written is in Java or Kotlin.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Java Heap**</dt>
<dd>Java Heap usage corresponds to the ‘Java Heap’ field from ADB.
    This is memory from objects allocated from Java or Kotlin code.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Stack**</dt>
<dd>Stack usage corresponds to the ‘Stack’ field from ADB. This is
memory used by both native and Java stacks in your app. This usually
relates to how many threads your app is running.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Graphics**</dt>
<dd>Graphics usage corresponds to the ‘Graphics’ field from ADB. This
is memory used for graphics buffer queues to display pixels on the screen,
including GL surfaces, GL textures, etc. Note: This is memory shared with
the CPU—not dedicated GPU memory.
</dd>
</dl>

## Memory controls

At the top of the memory page, above the charts, are several buttons and
dropdowns that control how memory data is displayed.

![Screenshot of a memory controls](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_controls.png){:width="100%"}

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Pause**</dt>
<dd>Pause the memory overview chart to allow inspecting
    the currently plotted data. Incoming memory data is still received;
    notice the Range selector continues to grow to the right.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Resume**</dt>
<dd>Resume the memory overview chart so that it is live, displaying the
    current time and the latest memory statistics.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Clear**</dt>
<dd>Clear all collected data from the memory profiler.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Display**</dt>
<dd>The duration of the x-axis. For example, if this dropdown
    is set to "Display 5 minutes", memory data from the last

<dt markdown="1">- Display 1 Minute</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display 5 Minutes</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display 10 Minutes</dt>
<dt markdown="1">- Display All Minutes (slider disabled)</dt>
<dt markdown="1">**Source**</dt>
<dd>Source can be either "Live Feed", which pulls data from the
    connected Flutter app, or one of the available offline data
    files, which are created by clicking "Export".</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Android Memory**</dt>
<dd>Displays or hides the Android Memory Chart.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**GC**</dt>
<dd>Initiates a garbage collection - compaction of the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Export**</dt>
<dd>Saves collected data for Event Timeline, Memory Overview Chart
    and Android Overview Chart. Files saved are displayed under the Source
    dropdown. Selecting a file loads the offline data.</dd>
</dl>

## Memory actions

Below the memory charts (Event Timeline, Memory Overview and Android Overview
charts) are interactive actions used to collect and analyze information about
memory usage while using the application DevTools is connected to there are two tabs:

![Two Tabs Memory Actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_two_tabs.png)

### Analysis tab

The Analysis tab collects memory snapshots both user initiated and
auto-collected by DevTools, when DevTools detects memory spikes.
Each snapshot is analyzed and an analysis is created too.

### Analysis actions

The actions available for Analysis are:

![Screenshot of a memory actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_analysis_actions.png)

**Snapshot** Clicking the Snapshot button makes a request to the
Dart VM to collect the current state of memory.  The
memory objects can be sorted by attributes such as class
name, size, allocated instances (see [Snapshot classes](#snapshots)).

**Treemap** If the Treemap switch is on the snapshot displays currently
active memory objects, the last snapshot, memory in a high-level
view as a tree map. (TBD details).

**Group By** Dropdown to select how data is grouped, which can either be by
instance or by class name.

**Collapse All** Collapse all nodes in the tree table.

**Expand All** Expand all nodes in the tree table

### Analysis and Snapshots view

All Analyses and Snapshots are displayed in a Table Tree View:

![Two Tabs Memory Actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_table_tree_view.png)

The snapshots are grouped by library and within library by class and
each class will display the list of known instances for that class.

A snapshot is a complete view of all memory objects at a particular
point in time.  Navigating, in the tree, to a class and it's instances
(if the constructor was called to create an instance).  If instances exists
expanding the class will display all live instances (objects). Clicking on
an instance, of a class, will bring up the memory inspector to the right-side
of the table tree.

![Two Tabs Memory Actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_navigate_inspect.png)

## Snapshots

![The Snapshot button](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_snapshot.png)

Clicking the **Snapshot** button shows the current state of the heap with regard
to all active classes and their instances. 

![Screenshot of the Snapshot classes](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_snapshot_tree.png)

This pane shows classes allocated in the heap, all instances for a class,
and the ability to inspect a particular instance.

In addition, a snapshot can automatically occur when DevTools notices a
spike in memory used (growth of > 40%).

Every snapshot, manual or automatic, will generate an analysis of the snapshot
e.g., groups image problems that might have occurred. In the future, other
common Flutter coding issues e.g., Fonts, Files, JSON, etc. that could cause
memory problems will be flagged.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Tree View of Memory**</dt>
<dd>The tree table view displays outstanding memory events (user
    requested snapshots, automatic snapshots, snapshot analyses,
    memory allocation monitoring).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Memory Inspector**</dt>
<dd>Display either the contents of an analysis, snapshot or
    monitoring based on the currently selected row in the tree view.
</dd>
</dl>

Snapshots have major tree nodes:
<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">External</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Memory that is not in the Dart heap but is still part
    of the total memory footprint. Objects in external memory would be
    native objects (for example, from a memory read from a file,
    or a decoded image). The native objects are exposed to the Dart
    VM from the native OS (such as Android, Linux, Windows, iOS)
    using a Dart embedder. The embedder creates a Dart wrapper with
    a finalizer, allowing Dart code to communicate with these native
    resources. Flutter has an embedder for Android and iOS.
    For more information, see [Dart on the Server][server] or
    [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders][embedder].
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">Filtered</dt>
<dd>Filter are the packages being filtered.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">Packages</dt>
<dd>User packages used by the application and Src - the empty Dart package.</dd>
</dl>

Under each of the above nodes are class nodes, an aggregate of the
objects allocated to this class. Clicking a class name displays a
list of class instances. and under each class are all the instances
of a class. Clicking on an instance will inspect the contents of that
instances (fields and values).

## Inspecting a class instance in a snapshot

Expanding a class displays the active instances for that class.
Clicking on an particular instance displays the type and value of
the fields for that instance.

![Screenshot of the inspecting an instance](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_inspector.png)

## Analysis of a snapshot

Every snapshot creates a corresponding Analyzed entry under the
Analysis node (the Analyzed date/time corresponds to the matching
Snapshot date/time).

![Screenshot of a Snapshot Analysis](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_analysis.png)

Currently, Analysis looks for common problems with images e.g.,
loading large files instead of scaled thumbnails, not using a
ListBuilder to manage images in a list, etc.

The Analysis pulls all Image related classes and instances from
a snapshot and organizes the data in one place instead of having
to search for the all the classes and inspect the instances to
understand what are just image related classes.

In the above Analysis the raw images are located in the Externals
portion of memory _Int32List (or _Int64List for newer phones)
organizes the instances sizes into buckets.  Eleven images are
10K-50K, one image is 10M-50M, seven images are 1M-10M and four
images are greater than 50M.  For a grand total of over 500M of
this app constitute images rendered as small images on a phone.

## Allocation tab

The Allocation tab allows monitoring the instances of all classes, reporting
the number of objects allocated and number of bytes consumed by all objects.
The numbers are displayed in absolute totals as well as accumulated totals.
Initially, the accumulated values (number of objects and size in bytes) are
equal to the initial totals at the time of the first monitor request. The
accumulators can be reset, to zero, at any time such that the next monitor
request will return the accumlated values since the last reset.

Additionally, a small set of classes can track the allocation of each instance
of a class. The tracking captures a stack trace when the constructor was
called. The overhead to track these allocations are expensive (slow) therefore
tracking should be used sparingly.

### Allocation actions

![Screenshot of a memory actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_allocations_actions.png)

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Track**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Records and monitors the number of instances

### Allocation view

Allocations are displayed in a table view of each class available to
the connected application:

![Two Tabs Memory Actions](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_allocations_overview.png)

Each row displays the class name the number of instances and bytes
allocated with deltas (accumulators since last reset).

### Managing the objects and statistics in the heap (Monitor Allocations)

![The Monitor Allocations button](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_monitor_allocations.png)

Clicking the allocation **Track** button monitors the total
number of instances and total number of bytes allocated for a class.
In addition, two accumulators are maintained for instances and bytes
allocated these accumulators can be reset, to zero, by user action
(pressing the Reset Accumulators button).  The mechanism is useful
to find memory leaks.

![Reset Accumulators button](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_reset.png)

When the **Reset** button is pressed, the accumulators for all classes
resets to zero. When reset is occurs a "monitor reset" event to the
Event Timeline.  Clicking the **Reset** button again resets both
accumulators to zero.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Classes**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Active classes in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Instances column**</dt>
<dd>Total active objects (instances) for all classes in the heap</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Delta column**</dt>
<dd>Accumulator counts of all instances since last "Reset" was pressed.
    Clicking the Reset button initializes the accumulated (Delta) instances
    of a class. This is useful for finding memory leaks.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Bytes column**</dt>
<dd>Total bytes consumed for all instances of a class in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Delta column**</dt>
<dd>Accumulator counts bytes allocated since last "Reset" was pressed.
    Clicking the Reset button initializes the accumulated (Delta) bytes for
    all instances of a class. This is useful for finding memory leaks.
</dd>
</dl>

## Allocation tracking

In addition to tracking the number of objects and bytes consumed
for all instances of a class, a stack trace can be recorded when a
class's constructor is called to help narrow where allocations might
be astray. To do this enable the Track checkbox for a class e.g.,

![Enable Stack Trace Tracking](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_enable_stacktrace.png)

Interact with your application then when you want to view the
instances allocation press the "Track" button again. This will
update the count for the instances being tracked e.g., 118 in the
below figure. Expanding the instances tracked will display all the
instances and timestamp when each instance was created e.g.,

![Class Tracking](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_tracking.png)

Selecting an instance will display the call stack at the time the
class's constructor (allocated) was called e.g.,

![Call Stack](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_tracking_callstack.png)

## Filtering, Searching and Auto-Complete

Both the Analysis and Allocations tabs support searching and filtering
Begin typing in the name of the class you'd like to find
e.g., **Ob**_ectWithUniqueId_ will return a list that matches the characters
typed so far. The first item in the list is highlighted.

Pressing a keystroke when auto-complete is visible:

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**ENTER**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Selects the highlighted line (GlobalObjectKey) and
                 navigates to the row with that class name in
                 the active tree table (Snapshot) or table (Allocations).
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**UP/DOWN arrows**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Rotates through the list of possible matches highlighting
                 the next item in the list.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**ESCAPE**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Clears and cancels all searching.
</dd>
</dl>

![Searching](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_search_1.png)

Typing more characters would narrow down the possible class names e.g., typing
**Obje** displays:

![Narrower Search](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_search_2.png)

Finally, typing **ObjectW** displays the exact match:

![Narrowed Search](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_search_3.png)

### Filtering

Filtering is used to move libraries and classes from the main list (tables)
to a Filter group to help reduce the number of classes visible that are
less important while profiling memory.

![Filtering](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_filtering.png)

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Hide Private Classes**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Class names prefix with an underscore.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Hide Classes with No Instances**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Classes never constructed are filtered.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Hide Libraries with No Instances**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">All classes in a library never constructed
                 the library is filtered.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Hide Libraries or Packages**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">List of all libraries used in your application
                 are displayed. By default the libraries enabled
                 above are filtered out (dart:*, package:flutter*,
                 etc.). The libraries automatically filtered can
                 be enabled if you are interested in Dart core
                 libraries and classes or the Flutter framework.
</dd>
</dl>

### Setting

The Memory profiler has a specific settings dialog:

![Settings](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/memory_settings.png)

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Collect Android Memory Statistics using ADB**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">By default if DevTools is connected to your
                 application via an Android device/emulator
                 then Android memory statistics are not collected.
                 Collecting with ADB can be expensive and may hide
                 performance issues in your app.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Display Data in Units (B, K, MB, GB)**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">By default data displayed in the hover card
                 are scaled using units instead of raw values.
                 Turning off this will display the raw numbers
                 e.g., 125M would display as 125,235,712
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Enable advanced memory settings**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">If enabled, the GC button is displayed to
                 ask the VM to garbage collect memory (manually).
                 This manual GC is only a request to the VM. The
                 VM may decide to do no compaction, some compaction
                 or complete compaction of the heap.
</dd>
</dl>

## Memory problem case study
Memory leak study using large network images was added with step-by-step
instructions on using DevTools Memory profiler, detecting the memory
problem and fixing the problem, see [case study][case_study].

## Glossary of VM terms

Here are some computer science concepts that will help you better
understand how your application uses memory.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Garbage collection (GC)**</dt>
<dd>GC is the process of searching the
    heap to locate, and reclaim, regions of "dead" memory&mdash;memory
    that is no longer being used by an application. This process
    allows the memory to be re-used and minimizes the risk of an
    application running out of memory, causing it to crash. Garbage
    collection is performed automatically by the Dart VM. In DevTools,
    you can perform garbage collection on demand by clicking the
    GC button.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Heap**</dt>
<dd>Dart objects that are dynamically allocated live in a portion of
    memory called the heap. An object allocated from the heap is freed
    (eligible for garbage collection) when nothing points to it,
    or when the application terminates. When nothing points to an
    object, it is considered to be dead. When an object is pointed
    to by another object, it is live.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Isolates**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Dart supports concurrent execution by way of isolates,
    which you can think of processes without the overhead.
    Each isolate has its own memory and code that can't be
    affected by any other isolate. For more information,
    see [The Event Loop and Dart][event-loop].
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Memory leak**</dt>
<dd>A memory leak occurs when an object is live
    (meaning that another object points to it), but it is not being
    used (so it shouldn't have any references from other objects).
    Such an object can't be garbage collected, so it takes up space
    in the heap and contributes to memory fragmentation.
    Memory leaks put unnecessary pressure on the VM and can be
    difficult to debug.
</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Virtual machine (VM)**</dt>
<dd>The Dart virtual machine is a piece of
    software that directly executes Dart code.
</dd>
