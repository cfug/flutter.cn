**Docs updated or added since the 3.22 release**

This website release includes several important updates!

* An updated widget catalog:
  * Added 37 missing widgets to the [Cupertino catalog][],
    and a new screenshot for the updated `CupertinoActionSheet` widget.
  * Added the new [`CarouselView`][] widget.
  * `CupertinoButton` and `CupertinoTextField`
    also have updated behaviors.
* New guides on adding support for Swift Package Manager
  to [iOS plugins][] and [iOS apps][]. (Note that,
  until all of your app's dependencies are migrated,
  Flutter will continue to use CocoaPods.)
* Updated web docs:
  * [Embedding Flutter on the web][], including how to
    enable multi-view mode
  * [Embedding web content into a Flutter app][]
* Update for Android 14:
  If you are using an Android device that runs on
  Android 14, you can now support Android's
  [predictive back gesture][].
* Updates for iOS 18:
  The iOS 18 release is in beta at the time of this release.
  These iOS 18 features are already enabled in Flutter
  and are now mentioned in the docs:
  * Use an [iOS app extension][] in your Flutter app
    to create a custom toggle. Your users can then
    add your app's toggle when customizing their
    Control Center.
  * [Tinted app icons][] are supported
* Two of the [First week experience][] pages are updated:
  * [Flutter fundamentals][]
  * [Layout][]
  We hope these pages are helpful for new Flutter developers.
* DevTools also has updates. Check out the release notes for
  [DevTools 2.35.0][], [DevTools 2.36.0][], and [DevTools 2.37.2][].
