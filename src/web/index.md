Flutter’s web support delivers the same experiences on the web as on mobile.
Building on the portability of Dart, the power of the web platform and the
flexibility of the Flutter framework, you can now build apps for iOS, Android,
and the browser from the same codebase. You can compile existing Flutter code
written in Dart into a web experience because it is exactly the same Flutter
framework and **web** is just another device target for your app.

Adding web support to Flutter involved implementing Flutter's
core drawing layer on top of standard browser APIs, in addition
to compiling Dart to JavaScript, instead of the ARM machine code that
is used for mobile applications. Using a combination of DOM, Canvas, 
and WebAssembly, Flutter can provide a portable, high-quality,
and performant user experience across modern browsers.
We implemented the core drawing layer completely in Dart
and used Dart's optimized JavaScript compiler to compile the
Flutter core and framework along with your application
into a single, minified source file that can be deployed to
any web server.

向 Flutter 添加 Web 支持涉及在标准浏览器 API
之上实现 Flutter 的核心绘图层。
通过结合使用 DOM、Canvas 和 CSS，Web 支持旨在为现代浏览器提供
便携、高质量和高性能的用户体验。
我们在 Dart 中完全实现了这个核心绘图层，
并使用 Dart 的优化过的 JavaScript 编译器将 Flutter 核心与框架，
同你的应用程序一起编译成一个可以部署到任何 Web 服务器的简化源文件。

While you can do a lot on the web, Flutter’s web support is most valuable in the
following scenarios:

**A [Progressive Web Application][] built with Flutter**
: Flutter delivers high-quality PWAs that are integrated with a user’s
  environment, including installation, offline support, and tailored UX.

**Single Page Application**
: Flutter’s web support enables complex standalone web apps that are rich with
  graphics and interactive content to reach end users on a wide variety of
  devices.

**Existing mobile applications**
: Web support for Flutter provides a browser-based delivery model for existing
  Flutter mobile apps.

Not every HTML scenario is ideally suited for Flutter at this time. 
For example, text-rich, flow-based, static content such as blog articles
benefit from the document-centric model that the web is built around,
rather than the app-centric services that a UI framework like Flutter
can deliver. However, you _can_ use Flutter to embed interactive
experiences into these websites.
