## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit,
with shipped support for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS,
and Linux. The team is constantly looking to improve our fidelity
on our supported platforms. To that end, we’re seeking software
engineers to join our iOS team.

## About the position

In the “iOS Engineer” role, you’ll be part of a team that makes
Flutter on iOS the absolute best it can be, including:

*   Delivering outstanding performance.
*   Delighting developers with a simple but powerful developer experience.
*   Making Flutter feel “native” on iOS (for example, by tying into system preferences and accessibility).
*   Allowing seamless and efficient interoperability with native iOS views and libraries.
*   Encouraging the growth and quality of the Flutter iOS plugin ecosystem on pub.dev.
*   Nurturing a thriving community of contributions from open-source developers
    by reviewing GitHub pull requests (PRs).

## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor,
who will help guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships,
and learning the systems you’ll need to do your job. Your manager
can also help you find mentors who can coach you as you navigate
your career at Google. In addition to formal mentors,
we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another,
and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google,
we embrace our differences and are
[committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).
In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/),
[Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/)
are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented employees
and their allies with shared values of creating belonging across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional
life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t
focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead,
we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive
and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work.
