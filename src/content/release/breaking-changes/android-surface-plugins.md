title: New APIs for Android plugins that render to a Surface
description: >
  Adds a new API, `SurfaceProducer`, to the Android embedding API, which
  opaquely handles the creation and management of a `Surface` for plugins. For
  Impeller, use of this API is required.
---

## Summary

The Android embedder for Flutter introduces a new API, [`SurfaceProducer`][],
which allows plugins to render to a `Surface` without needing to manage what
the backing implementation is. Plugins using the older
[`createSurfaceTexture`][] API will not work with [Impeller][].

## Background

An Android [`SurfaceTexture`][] is a backing implementation for a [`Surface`][]
that uses an [OpenGLES][] texture as the backing store.

For example, a plugin might display frames from a _camera_ plugin:

In newer versions of the Android API (>= 29), Android introduced a
backend-agnostic [`HardwareBuffer`][], which coincides with the minimum version
that Flutter will attempt to use the [Vulkan][] renderer. In order to support
this, the Android embedding API needed to be updated to support a more generic
`Surface` creation API that doesn't rely on OpenGLES.

## Migration guide

If you are using the older [`createSurfaceTexture`][] API, you should migrate to
the new [`createSurfaceProducer`][] API. The new API is more flexible and allows
the Flutter engine to opaquely pick the best implementation for the current
platform and API level.

1. Instead of creating a `SurfaceTextureEntry`, create a `SurfaceProducer`:

   ```diff
   - TextureRegistry.SurfaceTextureEntry entry = textureRegistry.createSurfaceTexture();
   + TextureRegistry.SurfaceProducer producer = textureRegistry.createSurfaceProducer();
   ```

1. Instead of creating a `new Surface(...)`, call [`getSurface()`][] on the
   `SurfaceProducer`:

   ```diff
   - Surface surface = new Surface(entry.surfaceTexture());
   + Surface surface = producer.getSurface();
   ```

Otherwise, the API is the same as before.

## Timeline

Landed in version: 3.22.0-12.0.pre-56

:::note
This feature landed in the _previous_ version of the SDK but was non-functional;
plugins that migrate to this API should set `3.22` as a minimum version constraint.
:::

In stable release: 3.22.0
