title: Customizing web app initialization
description: Customize how Flutter apps are initialized on the web
---

You can customize how a Flutter app is initialized on the web
using the `_flutter.loader` JavaScript API provided by `flutter.js`.
This API can be used to display a loading indicator in CSS,
prevent the app from loading based on a condition,
or wait until the user presses a button before showing the app.

The initialization process is split into the following stages:

**Loading the entrypoint script**
: Fetches the `main.dart.js` script and initializes the service worker.

**Initializing the Flutter engine**
: Initializes Flutter's web engine by downloading required resources
  such as assets, fonts, and CanvasKit.

**Running the app**
: Prepares the DOM for your Flutter app and runs it.

This page shows how to customize the behavior
at each stage of the initialization process.

## Getting started

By default, the `index.html` file
generated by the `flutter create` command
contains a script tag
that calls `loadEntrypoint` from the `flutter.js` file:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="flutter.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      window.addEventListener('load', function (ev) {
        // Download main.dart.js
        _flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
          serviceWorker: {
            serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
          },
          onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
            // Initialize the Flutter engine
            let appRunner = await engineInitializer.initializeEngine();
            // Run the app
            await appRunner.runApp();
          }
        });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```



{{site.alert.note}}
  In Flutter 2.10 or earlier,
  this script doesn't support customization.
  To upgrade your `index.html` file to the latest version,
  see [Upgrading an older project](#upgrading-an-older-project).
{{site.alert.end}}



The `loadEntrypoint` function calls the `onEntrypointLoaded` callback
once the Service Worker is initialized, and the `main.dart.js` entrypoint
has been downloaded and run by the browser. Flutter also calls
`onEntrypointLoaded` on every hot restart during development.

The `onEntrypointLoaded` callback receives an **engine initializer** object as
its only parameter. Use the engine initializer to set the run-time
configuration, and start the Flutter Web engine.

The `initializeEngine()` function returns a [`Promise`][js-promise]
that resolves with an **app runner** object. The app runner has a
single method, `runApp()`, that runs the Flutter app.

## Customizing web app initialization

In this section,
learn how to customize each stage of your app’s initialization.

### Loading the entrypoint

The `loadEntrypoint` method accepts these parameters:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">

| Name | Description | JS&nbsp;Type |
|-|-|-|
|`entrypointUrl`| The URL of your Flutter app's entrypoint. Defaults to `"main.dart.js"`. |`String`|
|`onEntrypointLoaded`| The function called when the engine is ready to be initialized. Receives an `engineInitializer` object as its only parameter. |`Function`|
|`serviceWorker`| The configuration for the `flutter_service_worker.js` loader. (If not set, the service worker won’t be used.) |`Object`|
{:.table}

</div>

The `serviceWorker` JavaScript object accepts the following properties:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">

| Name | Description | JS&nbsp;Type |
|-|-|-|
|`serviceWorkerUrl`| The URL of the Service Worker JS file. The `serviceWorkerVersion` is appended to the URL. Defaults to `"flutter_service_worker.js?v="` |`String`|
|`serviceWorkerVersion`| Pass *the `serviceWorkerVersion` variable* set by the build process in your **`index.html`** file. |`String`|
|`timeoutMillis`| The timeout value for the service worker load. Defaults to `4000`. |`Number`|
{:.table}

</div>

### Initializing the engine

As of _Flutter 3.7.0_, you can use the `initializeEngine` method to
configure several run-time options of the Flutter web engine through a
plain JavaScript object.

You can add any of the following optional parameters:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">

| Name | Description | Dart&nbsp;Type |
|-|-|-|
|`assetBase`| The base URL of the `assets` directory of the app. Add this when Flutter loads from a different domain or subdirectory than the actual web app. You may need this when you embed Flutter web into another app, or when you deploy its assets to a CDN. |`String`|
|`canvasKitBaseUrl`| The base URL from where `canvaskit.wasm` is downloaded. |`String`|
|`canvasKitVariant`| The CanvasKit variant to download. Your options cover:<br><br>1. `auto`: Downloads the optimal variant for the browser. The option defaults to this value.<br>2. `full`: Downloads the full variant of CanvasKit that works in all browsers.<br>3. `chromium`: Downloads a smaller variant of CanvasKit that uses Chromium compatible APIs. **_Warning_**: Don't use the `chromium` option unless you plan on only using Chromium-based browsers. |`String`|
|`canvasKitForceCpuOnly`| When `true`, forces CPU-only rendering in CanvasKit (the engine won't use WebGL). |`bool`|
|`canvasKitMaximumSurfaces`| The maximum number of overlay surfaces that the CanvasKit renderer can use. |`double`|
|`debugShowSemanticNodes`| If `true`, Flutter visibly renders the semantics tree onscreen (for debugging).  |`bool`|
|`hostElement`| HTML Element into which Flutter renders the app. When not set, Flutter web takes over the whole page. |`HtmlElement`|
|`renderer`| Specifies the [web renderer][web-renderers] for the current Flutter application, either `"canvaskit"` or `"html"`. |`String`|
{:.table}

</div>

{{site.alert.note}}
  Some of the parameters described above might have been overridden
  in previous releases by using properties in the `window` object.
  That approach is still supported, but displays a **deprecation
  notice** in the JS console, as of **Flutter 3.7.0**.

#### Engine configuration example

The `initializeEngine` method lets you pass any of the configuration
parameters described above to your Flutter app.

Consider the following example.

Your Flutter app should target an HTML element with `id="flutter_app"` and
use the `canvaskit` renderer. The resulting JavaScript code would resemble
the following:

```js
onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
  let appRunner = await engineInitializer.initializeEngine({
    hostElement: document.querySelector("#flutter_app"),
    renderer: "canvaskit"
  });
  appRunner.runApp();
}
```

For a more detailed explanation of each parameter, take a look at the
**"Runtime parameters"** documentation section of the [`configuration.dart`][config-dart]
file of the web engine.

[config-dart]: {{site.github}}/flutter/engine/blob/main/lib/web_ui/lib/src/engine/configuration.dart#L150

#### Skipping this step

Instead of calling `initializeEngine()` on the engine initializer (and then
`runApp()` on the application runner), you can call `autoStart()` to
initialize the engine with its default configuration, and then start the app
immediately after the initialization is complete:


```js
_flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
  serviceWorker: {
    serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
  },
  onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
    await engineInitializer.autoStart();
  }
});
```

## Example: Display a progress indicator

To give the user of your application feedback
during the initialization process,
use the hooks provided for each stage to update the DOM:


```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="flutter.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="loading"></div>
    <script>
      window.addEventListener('load', function(ev) {
        var loading = document.querySelector('#loading');
        loading.textContent = "Loading entrypoint...";
        _flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
          serviceWorker: {
            serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
          },
          onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
            loading.textContent = "Initializing engine...";
            let appRunner = await engineInitializer.initializeEngine();

            loading.textContent = "Running app...";
            await appRunner.runApp();
          }
        });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Upgrading an older project

If your project was created in Flutter 2.10 or earlier,
you can create a new `index.html` file
with the latest initialization template by running
`flutter create` as follows.

First, remove the files from your `/web` directory.

Then, from your project directory, run the following:

```
$ flutter create . --platforms=web
```
