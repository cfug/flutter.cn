To learn about Flutter's original (1.0)
navigation and routing mechanism,
see the [Navigation recipes][] in the
[Flutter cookbook][] and the [`Navigator`][] API docs.
The original navigation model uses an imperative approach.

To learn about Flutter's updated (2.0) navigation and
routing mechanism, which uses a declarative approach, see
[Learning Flutter’s new navigation and routing system][].

Note that this new mechanism isn't a breaking change&mdash;you can continue
to use the original approach if that serves you well.
If you want to implement deep linking, or take advantage
of multiple navigators, check out the 2.0 version.
