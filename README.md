## Issues, bugs, and requests

We welcome contributions and feedback on our website!
Please file a request in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new)
and we'll take a look.

If you have an issue with the API docs on
[api.flutter.dev](https://api.flutter.dev),
please file those issues on the
[flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues)
repo, not on this (flutter/website) repo.
The API docs are embedded in Flutter's source code,
so the engineering team handles those.

> NOTE: For simple changes (such as to CSS and text),
> you probably don't need to build this site.
> Often, you can make changes using the GitHub UI.
> If you want/need to build, read on.

## Before you submit a PR

We love it when the community gets involved in improving
our docs! But here are a few notes to keep in mind before
you submit a PR:

* When triaging issues, we sometimes label an issue with
  the tag, "PRs welcome". But we welcome PRs on other
  issues as well&mdash;it doesn't have to be tagged with
  that label.
* Please realize that we follow (or try to follow)
  the [Google Developer Documentation Style
  Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style).
  So please don't run our docs through Grammarly (or similar)
  and submit those changes as a PR. This guide is a reference
  doc and not meant to be read like a novel, but check out the
  [highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)
  page or use the search bar to find your subject of interest.
  Also, the [wordlist](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list)
  is very useful. (For example, don't use "i.e." or "e.g.",
  and avoid writing in first person.)

We truly thank you for your willingness and helpfulness
in keeping the website docs up to date!!

## Before you build this site

### 1. Get the prerequisites

Install the following tools, if you don't have them already.

- **bash**, the Bourne shell. These instructions assume you're using `bash` -- setup might not work if you use another shell.
- **[nvm][]**, the Node Version Manager.

  > NOTE: To make `nvm` immediately available in your current shell, run `source <PATH_TO_INSTALLATION>`. For example:
  > ```console
  > $ source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
  > ```

- **[rvm][]**, the Ruby Version Manager.

  > NOTE: To make `rvm` immediately available in your current shell, run `source <PATH_TO_INSTALLATION>`. For example:
  > ```console
  > $ source ~/.rvm/bin/rvm
  > ```

- **[Flutter][Flutter install]** (You get Dart when you get Flutter. Confirm with
  `which flutter` and `which dart`.)
- **[GNU diffutils][]** version 3.6 or later.
  > NOTE: `diff` v3.6+ is required to ensure that in-page code diffs are
  > consistently refreshed across macOS and Linux. [Issue #3076][] was due to
  > the default macOS `diff` being at v2.x. To upgrade `diffutils`, run:<br>
  > ```console
  > $ brew install diffutils
  > ```
  > [issue #3076]: https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/3076

> IMPORTANT: Follow the installation instructions for each of the tools
> carefully. In particular, configure your shell/environment so
> that the tools are available in every terminal/command window you create.

### 2. Clone this repo _and_ its submodules

> NOTE: This repo has git _submodules_, which affects how you clone it.

To **clone [flutter/website]()** (this repo), follow the instructions given in the
GitHub help on [Cloning a repository][], then _choose one_ of the following
submodule-cloning techniques:

- Clone this repo and its submodule _at the same_, use the
  `--recurse-submodules` option:<br>

  ```console
  $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flutter/website.git
  ```

  OR
- If you've already cloned this repo without its submodule, then run
  this command from the repo root:<br>

  ```console
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

> NOTE: At any time during development you can use the `git submodule` command to
> refresh submodules:<br>
> ```console
> $ git pull; git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

### 3. Run installation scripts

> NOTE: It is safe to (re-)run all of the commands and scripts given below even
> if you already have the required packages installed.

**Open a bash terminal/command window** and execute the following commands:

1. After you have cloned this repo, change to the _root of this repo_:

   ```console
   $ cd <PATH_TO_REPO>
   ```
1.  Run the `env-set.sh` script to initialize environment variables, and to install/use required Node & Ruby version:

    ```console
    $ source ./tool/env-set.sh
    ```
1.  Run `before-install.sh` to install the  core set of required tools:

    ```console
    $ ./tool/before-install.sh
    ```
1.  Run `install.sh` to install everything else needed to build this site:

    ```console
    $ ./tool/install.sh
    ```

> IMPORTANT:
> - Any time you create a **new terminal/command window** to work on
>   this repo, **repeat steps 1 and 2** above.

## Developing and serving changes

 1. After you clone this repo, create a branch. For example:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
    ```

 1. Make your changes, then commit them to the branch.
 1. Test your changes by serving the site locally.
    To serve locally, run _either one_ of these commands:
    - ```console
      $ ./tool/serve.sh # or npm run start
      ```

    OR
    - ```console
      $ bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --watch --livereload --port 4002
      ```

      > NOTE: Unless you're editing files under `site-shared`, you can safely
      > ignore `ERROR: directory is already being watched` messages.
      > For details, see [#1363](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/1363).

      > NOTE: The first time you run either one of these commands,
      > Jekyll takes anywhere between 10-20 seconds to generate static
      > content inside the `_sites` directory. If you try to verify the
      > site locally, but aren't able to see the content right away,
      > wait 20 seconds before stopping the server or concluding that
      > something is wrong.
 1. Before submitting, validate site links:<br>
    ```console
    $ ./tool/shared/check-links.sh
    ```

> TIP: Sometimes Jekyll gets confused and seems to be out-of-sync. (This might
> happen, for example, when you pull from master and lots of files have moved.)
> To fix Jekyll, stop the `serve.sh` script, remove the generated site files:
> hand, and then restart the `serve.sh` script:

> ```console
> $ npm run clean
> ```
> OR
> ```console
> $ jekyll clean
> ```
> OR
> ```console
> $ rm -Rf ./_site/* ./.jekyll*
> ```

> Next, restart the `serve.sh` script:

> ```console
> $ npm run start
> ```
> OR
> ```console
> $ ./tool/serve.sh
> ```

## Creating and/or editing DartPad example code

Most of the code used to create DartPad examples is hosted on GitHub. However, this repo also contains
some `.dart` files responsible for DartPad example code.

### DartPad example code in GitHub gists

A typical DartPad example takes the form of an `iframe`, for example, within a codelab's markdown file:

```markdown
<iframe
  src="{{site.custom.dartpad.embed-flutter-prefix}}?id=d7b09149ffee2f0535bb0c04d96987f5"
  style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px"
  frameborder="no" height="500" width="100%"
></iframe>
```

This `iframe` depends on the following GitHub gist url:

```none
https://gist.github.com/d7b09149ffee2f0535bb0c04d96987f5
```

For detailed instructions on how to use this approach to DartPad examples, see the [DartPad embedding guide].

### DartPad example code in this repo - `src/_packages/dartpad_picker`

Some DartPad example code remains in `.dart` files in this repo, and must be compiled via `src/_packages/dartpad_picker/compile.sh`. For an example, consult `src/_packages/dartpad_picker/web/dartpad_picker_main.dart`.

In order to create or change example code using `dartpad_picker`, you must regenerate the JavaScript:

```sh
  $ cd src/_packages/dartpad_picker
  $ ./compile.sh
```

## Deploy to a staging site

You can deploy your local edits to a personal staging site as follows.

 1. Serve your changes locally, as previously instructed.
    Keep the `serve.sh` script running in its own `bash` shell.

 1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com),
    create your own Firebase project (e.g. `my-foo`). You only need
    to do this step once.

 1. In a separate `bash` shell, change to the repo directory and
    initialize Firebase:

    ```console
    $ npx firebase init
    ```

 1. Tell Firebase about your project with the
    [`firebase use` command](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/07/deploy-to-multiple-environments-with.html)
    You only need to do this step once:

      ```console
      $ npx firebase use --add
      ? Which project do you want to add? <select the project you created>
      ? What alias do you want to use for this project? (e.g. staging) my-foo
      ```

 1. Tell Firebase that you want to deploy to staging:

    ```console
    $ npx firebase use my-foo
    Now using alias staging (my-foo)
    ```

 1. Tell Firebase to execute deployment of your project:

   ```console
   $ npx firebase deploy
   ```

   Your personal version of the Flutter website is now deployed to Firebase.
   Copy the serving URL from the command output.

### Alternate deployment script

Alternatively, you can skip the previous steps and just use the deploy script:

```console
$ ./tool/shared/deploy.sh --local my-foo

=== Deploying to '<your project name>'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting: preparing _site directory for upload...
✔  hosting: 213 files uploaded successfully
i  starting release process (may take several minutes)...

✔  Deploy complete!
```

## Deploying to the official site

As of Feb 23, 2021, official site deploys are
performed by GitHub Actions.
In the event that you need to manually deploy,
use the deploy script and the `default` project:

```
$ ./tool/shared/deploy.sh --local --robots ok default
```

## Writing for flutter.dev

The [site-shared](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-shared) repo
contains infrastructure shared by most of our Dart and Flutter websites.
Some of this README is in the
[doc](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-shared/tree/master/doc)
directory in the site-shared repo.
