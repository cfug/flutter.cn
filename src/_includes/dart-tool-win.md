  As of Flutter's 1.19.0 dev release, the Flutter SDK
  contains the `dart` command alongside the `flutter`
  command so that you can more easily run Dart
  command-line programs. Downloading the Flutter SDK
  also downloads the compatible version of Dart,
  but if you've downloaded the Dart SDK separately,
  make sure that the Flutter version of `dart` is
  first in your path, as the two versions might not be compatible.
  The following command tells you whether the `flutter` and `dart`
  commands originate from the same `bin` directory and are
  therefore compatible.

  自 Flutter 1.19.0 dev 版本开始，Flutter SDK 在 `flutter` 命令脚本的同级目录下增加了 `dart` 命令，
  你可以更方便地运行 Dart 命令行程序。
  下载 Flutter SDK 时也会下载对应版本的 Dart SDK，但如果你单独下载了 Dart SDK，
  请确保 Flutter SDK 内的 `dart` 在你的环境变量中排在首位，因为单独的 SDK 可能并不兼容 Flutter SDK。
  下面的命令展示了 `flutter` 和 `dart` 是否来自相同的 `bin` 目录，并且是否可以兼容使用。

  ```terminal
  C:\>where flutter dart
  C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\flutter
  C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\flutter.bat
  C:\path-to-dart-sdk\bin\dart.exe        :: this should go after `C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\` commands
  C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\dart
  C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\dart.bat
  ```

  As shown above, the command `dart` from the Flutter SDK doesn't come first.
  Update your path to use commands from `C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\` before
  commands from `C:\path-to-dart-sdk\bin\` (in this case).
  After restarting your shell for the change to take effect,
  running the `where` command again
  should show that the `flutter` and `dart` commands
  from the same directory now come first.

如上所示，Flutter SDK 内的 `dart` 命令不在首位。
你需要更新 PATH，将 `C:\path-to-flutter-sdk\bin\` 放在 `C:\path-to-dart-sdk\bin\` 前面（当前场景）。
接着重启命令行使修改生效，再次运行 `where`，此时来自相同目录的 `flutter` 和 `dart` 已经排在前面。

  ```terminal
  C:\>where flutter dart
  C:\dev\src\flutter\bin\flutter
  C:\dev\src\flutter\bin\flutter.bat
  C:\dev\src\flutter\bin\dart
  C:\dev\src\flutter\bin\dart.bat
  C:\dev\src\dart-sdk\bin\dart.exe
  ```

  However, if you are using `PowerShell`, in it `where` is
  an alias of `Where-Object` command, so you need to use `where.exe` instead.

然而，如果你在使用 `PowerShell`，`where` 其实是 `Where-Object` 命令的别名，
所以实际上你需要运行 `where.exe`。

  ```terminal
  PS C:\> where.exe flutter dart
  ```


  To learn more about the `dart` command, run `dart -h`
  from the command line, or see the [dart tool][] page.

  了解更多 `dart` 命令的用法，可以在命令行中运行 `dart -h` 查看，
