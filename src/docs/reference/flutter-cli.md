The `flutter` command-line tool is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of
developers) interact with Flutter.

Here's how you might use the `flutter` tool to create, analyze, test, and run an
app:

```terminal
$ flutter create my_app
$ cd my_app
$ flutter analyze
$ flutter test
$ flutter run lib/main.dart
```

To run [`pub`][] commands using the `flutter` tool:

```terminal
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter pub outdated
$ flutter pub upgrade
```

To view all commands that `flutter` supports:

```terminal
$ flutter --help --verbose
```

To get the current version of the Flutter SDK, including its framework, engine,
and tools:

```terminal
$ flutter --version
```
