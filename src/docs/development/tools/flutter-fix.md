The _Flutter Fix_ feature, introduced in Flutter 2,
combines a Dart command-line tool with
changes suggested by the Dart analyzer
to automatically clean up deprecated APIs
in your codebase.

This feature has also been added to IDE
plugins for Flutter (2.0) and Dart (2.12).
Depending on the IDE, these automated
updates are called _quick-fixes_ (IntelliJ,
Android Studio, Eclipse) or _code actions_ (VS Code).

## Applying individual fixes

You can use any supported IDE
to apply a single fix at a time.

### IntelliJ and Android Studio

When the analyzer detects a deprecated API,
a light bulb appears on that line of code.
Clicking the light bulb displays the suggested fix
that updates that code to the new API.
Clicking the suggested fix performs the update.

### VS Code

When the analyzer detects a deprecated API,
it presents an error.
You can do any of the following:

* Hover over the error and then click the
  **Quick Fix** link.
  This presents a filtered list showing
  _only_ fixes.
* Put the caret in the code with the error and click
  the light bulb icon that appears.
  This shows a list of all actions, including
  refactors.
* Put the caret in the code with the error and
  press the shortcut
  (**Command+.** on Mac, **Control+.** elsewhere)
  This shows a list of all actions, including
  refactors.

## Applying project-wide fixes

To see or apply changes to an entire project,
you can use the command-line tool, [`dart fix`][].

This tool has two options:

* To see a full list of available changes, run
  the following command:

  ```terminal
  dart fix --dry-run
  ```

* To apply all changes in bulk, run the
  following command:

  ```terminal
  dart fix --apply
  ```
