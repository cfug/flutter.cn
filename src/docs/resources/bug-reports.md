The instructions in this document detail the current steps
required to provide the most actionable bug reports for
crashes and other bad behavior. Each step is optional but
will greatly improve how quickly issues are diagnosed and addressed.
We appreciate your effort in sending us as much feedback as possible.

## Create an issue on GitHub

* To report a Flutter crash or bug,
  [create an issue in the flutter/flutter project][Flutter issue].
* To report a problem with the website,
  [create an issue in the flutter/website project][Website issue].

## Provide some Flutter diagnostics

* Run `flutter doctor` in your project directory and paste
  the results into the GitHub issue:

```none
[✓] Flutter (on Mac OS, channel master)
    • Flutter at /Users/me/projects/flutter
    • Framework revision 8cbeb2e (4 hours ago), engine revision 5c28578

[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 23.0.2)
    • Android SDK at /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.4.1_1
    • Platform android-23, build-tools 23.0.2
    • Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)

[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 7.3)
    • XCode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    • Xcode 7.3, Build version 7D175

[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2016.2.5)
    • Dart plugin installed
    • Flutter plugin installed
```

## Run the command in verbose mode

Follow these steps only if your issue is related to the
`flutter` tool.

* All Flutter commands accept the `--verbose` flag.
  If attached to the issue, the output from this command
  might aid in diagnosing the problem.
* Attach the results of the command to the GitHub issue.

## Provide the most recent logs

* Logs for the currently connected device are accessed
  using `flutter logs`.
* If the crash is reproducible, clear the logs
  (⌘ + k on Mac), reproduce the crash and copy the
  newly generated logs into a file attached to the bug report.
* If you are getting exceptions thrown by the framework,
  include all the output between and including the dashed
  lines of the first such exception.

## Provide the crash report

* When the iOS simulator crashes,
  a crash report is generated in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`.
* When an iOS device crashes,
  a crash report is generated in `~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice`.
* Find the report corresponding to the crash (usually the latest)
  and attach it to the GitHub issue.
