# DevTools 2.9.2 release notes

Dart & Flutter DevTools - A Suite of Performance Tools for Dart and Flutter

## General Updates

* Take our 2022 DevTools survey! Provide your feedback and help us improve
  your development experience. This survey prompt will show up directly in
  DevTools sometime in mid-February.

*Note*: If you are having issues launching the survey, please make
sure you have upgraded to the latest Flutter stable branch 2.10.
There was a bug in DevTools (fixed in
[#3574](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/3574)) that
prevented the survey from being able to be opened, and unless you
are on Flutter 2.10, this bug will still be present._
