To get started with Flutter, 
you need to have some familiarity with two subjects: 
the Dart programming language, which Flutter 
applications are written in, and widgets, 
which are the building blocks of Flutter UI. 
Both will be introduced on this page, but you’ll continue
learning about each throughout this series. 
Additional resources are listed throughout this page, 
but you do not need to be an expert in either 
subject in order to continue.

## Dart

Flutter applications are built in [Dart][],
a language that will look familiar
to anyone who's written Java, Javascript,
or any other C-like language.  

:::note
Installing Flutter also installs Dart,
so you don't need to install Dart separately.
:::

The following example is a small program that 
fetches data from dart.dev, decodes the returned json, 
and prints it to the console. 
If you’re confident in your ability to 
understand this program, 
feel free to skip to the next section on this page.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class Package {
  final String name, latestVersion; 
  String? description;

  Package(this.name, this.latestVersion, this.description);

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'Package{name: $name, latestVersion: $latestVersion, description: $description}';
  }
}

void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final httpPackageResponse = await http.get(httpPackageUrl);
  if (httpPackageResponse.statusCode != 200) {
    print('Failed to retrieve the http package!');
    return;
  }
  final json = jsonDecode(httpPackageResponse.body);
  final package = Package(json['name'], json['latestVersion'], json['description']);
  print(package);
}
```

This program has two parts: 
the `Package` class declaration, and the business logic, 
which is contained in the [`main`][] function.

The `Package` class contains many of the most common
features you’ll use when working with [classes in Dart][].
This class has three members, 
and defines a constructor and a method.

The Dart language is [type safe][]; it uses 
static type checking to ensure that 
a variable's value always matches the
variable's static type. 
When defining a class, annotating the members with 
`String` is required, 
but it is often optional due to type inference. 
In the `main` function in this example 
there are many lines that start with `final variableName =`. 
These lines are type safe, 
despite not being explicitly given a type.

Dart also has built-in [sound null safety][]. 
In the example, the `description` member is 
declared with the type `String?`. 
The `?` at the end of `String?` means that 
this property can be null. 
The other two members cannot be null, 
and the program will not compile if 
you tried to set them to null. 
You can see this demonstrated in the constructor for 
the ‘Package class’. It takes two required,
positional arguments and one optional, named argument.

Next in the example is the `main` function. 
All Dart programs, including Flutter apps, 
start with a `main`function. 
The function showcases several basic Dart language features, 
including using libraries, marking functions as async, 
making function calls, using `if` statement control-flow,
and more.

:::note Where does initialization code go?
The main entrypoint in a starter
Flutter app is in `lib/main.dart`.
The default `main` method looks
like the following:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}       

```

Perform any _quick_ initialization (less than a frame or two)
_before_ calling `runApp()`,
though be aware that the widget tree hasn't been created yet.
If you want to perform initialization that takes awhile,
such as loading data from disk or over a network,
do it in a way that won't block the main UI thread.
For more information, check out [Asynchronous programming][],
the [`FutureBuilder`][] API, [Deferred components][],
or the [Working with long lists][] cookbook recipe,
as appropriate.

[Asynchronous programming]: {{site.dart-site}}/libraries/async/async-await
[Deferred components]: /perf/deferred-components
[`FutureBuilder`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html
[Working with long lists]: /cookbook/lists/long-lists

Every stateful widget has an `initState()`
method that is called when the widget is
created and added to the widget tree.
You can override this method and perform
initialization there, though the first line of
this method _must_ be `super.initState()`.

Finally, hot reloading your app does _not_
call `initState` or `main` again.
Hot restart calls both.

If these features aren’t familiar to you, 
read [Introduction to Dart][] from the Dart documentation.

## Widgets

In regard to Flutter, you'll often hear
"everything is a widget". 
Widgets are the building blocks of a 
Flutter app's user interface, 
and each widget is an immutable declaration of part 
of the user interface. Widgets are used 
to describe all aspects of a user interface,
including physical aspects such as text and buttons to
lay out effects like padding and alignment.

Widgets form a hierarchy based on composition. 
Each widget nests inside its parent and 
can receive context from the parent. 
This structure carries all the way up to the root
widget, as this trivial example shows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp( // Root widget
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My Home Page'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Column(
                children: [
                  const Text('Hello, World!'),
                  const SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      print('Click!');
                    },
                    child: const Text('A button'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the preceding code, 
all instantiated classes are widgets: 
`MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Text`,
`Center`, `Builder`, `Column`, `SizedBox`, and
`ElevatedButton`.

### Widget composition

As mentioned, Flutter emphasizes widgets as a unit
of composition. Widgets are typically composed of
many other small, single-purpose widgets that
combine to produce powerful effects.

There are layout widgets such
as `Padding`, `Alignment`, `Row`, `Column`,
and `Grid`. These layout widgets do not have a
visual representation of their own. 
Instead, their sole purpose is to 
control some aspect of another widget's layout. 
Flutter also includes utility widgets that 
take advantage of this compositional approach. 
For example, `Container`, a commonly used widget, 
is made up of several widgets responsible for layout, 
painting, positioning, and sizing.
Some widgets have visual representation, 
such as `ElevatedButton` and 
`Text` in the preceding example, as well as
widgets like `Icon` and `Image`.

If you run the code from the preceding example, 
Flutter paints a button with the text
"Hello, World!" centered on the screen, laid out vertically. 
To position these elements, there’s a`Center` widget, 
which positions its children in the center
of the available space, and a `Column` widget, 
which lays out its children vertically one after another.

In the [next page][] in this series, you will
learn more about layout in Flutter.

### Building widgets

To create a user interface in Flutter, 
you override the [`build`][] method on widget objects. 
All widgets must have a build method, 
and it must return another widget. For example, 
if you want to add text to the screen with some padding, 
you could write it like this:

```dart
class PaddedText extends StatelessWidget {
  const PaddedText({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: const Text('Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

The framework calls the `build` method when this 
widget is created and when the dependencies of this
widget change (such as state that is passed into the widget). 
This method can potentially be called in every frame
and should not have any side effects beyond 
building a widget. 
For more information on how Flutter renders widgets, 
read [Flutter architectural overview][].

### Widget state
The framework introduces two major classes of widget: 
stateful and stateless widgets.

Widgets that have no mutable state 
(they have no class properties 
that change over time) subclass [`StatelessWidget`][]. 
Many built-in widgets are stateless, 
such as `Padding`, `Text`, and `Icon`. 
When you create your own widgets, 
you’ll create `Stateless` widgets most of the time.

On the other hand, 
if the unique characteristics of a widget need to change 
based on user interaction or other factors, 
that widget is stateful. 
For example, if a widget has a counter that 
increments whenever the user taps a button, 
then the value of the counter is the state for that widget. 
When that value changes, the widget needs to be 
rebuilt to update its part of the UI. 
These widgets subclass [`StatefulWidget`][], 
and (because the widget itself is immutable) 
they store mutable state in a separate class that 
subclasses [`State`][]. 
`StatefulWidgets` don't have a `build` method; 
instead, their user interface is built through
their `State` object, as shown in the example below.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<CounterWidget> createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
    int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('$_counter');
  }
}
```

Whenever you mutate a `State` object 
(for example, by incrementing the counter), 
you must call [`setState`][] to signal the framework
to update the user interface by 
calling the `State`'s `build` method again.

Separating state from widget objects 
lets other widgets treat both 
stateless and stateful widgets in exactly the same way, 
without being concerned about losing state. 
Instead of needing to hold on to 
a child to preserve its state,
the parent can create a new instance of the child
at any time without losing 
the child's persistent state. 
The framework does all the work of finding and 
reusing existing state objects when appropriate.

There’s more information about 
[`StatefulWidget`][] objects later in this 
series, in the [state management lesson][].

## Important widgets to know

The Flutter SDK includes many built-in widgets,
from the smallest pieces of UI, like `Text`,
to layout widgets, and widgets that style
your application. The following widgets are
the most important to be aware of as you move onto the
next lesson in the learning pathway.

* [`Container`][]
* [`Text`][]
* [`Scaffold`][]
* [`AppBar`][]
* [`Row`][] and [`Column`][]
* [`ElevatedButton`][]
* [`Image`][]
* [`Icon`][]

This page is an introduction to foundational
Flutter concepts, like widgets,
and helps you become familiar with reading
Flutter and Dart code. It's okay if you don't
feel clear on every topic you encountered, as every page after
this is a deep-dive on specific topics.
In the next section, you'll start building more
