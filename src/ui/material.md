Material Design is an open-source design system built
and supported by Google designers and developers.

The latest version, Material 3, enables personal,
adaptive, and expressive experiencesâ€”from dynamic color
and enhanced accessibility, to foundations for
large screen layouts, and design tokens.
Flutter is in the process of migrating to Material 3.

{{site.alert.note}}
  A few facts about Material 3 (M3),
  the next generation of Material Design:

  * Most Flutter widgets are already migrated to M3,
    but you can follow progress on the
    [Material 3 Flutter GitHub project][] and the
    [GitHub umbrella issue][].
  * You can opt in to
    Material 3 using the [`useMaterial3`][] flag.
    However, your UI might be inconsistent until
    _all_ of Flutter _and_ your code are migrated.
  * For the latest list of Flutter's widgets that
    are affected by the [`useMaterial3`][] flag, see
    [Affected widgets][].
  * The vast majority of Flutter widgets have similar
    behavior in M2 and M3, so those widget names are unchanged.
    However, a couple widgets have substantially different
    behavior in M3, so new widgets have been created.
  * Once migration is complete, Material 3 will
    become the Material library's default look and feel.
  * Support for Material 2 will eventually be removed according
    to Flutter's [deprecation policy][].
