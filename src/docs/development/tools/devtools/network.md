{{site.alert.note}}
  The network view works with all Flutter and Dart applications.
{{site.alert.end}}

## What is it?

The network view allows you to inspect HTTP, HTTPS, and web socket traffic from
your Dart or Flutter application.

## How to use it

Network traffic should be recording by default when you open the Network page.
If it is not, click the **Record network traffic** button in the upper left to
begin polling.

Select a network request from the table (left) to view details (right). You can
inspect general and timing information about the request, as well as the content
of response and request headers and bodies.

### Search and filtering

You can use the search and filter controls to find a specific request or filter
requests out of the request table.

To apply a filter, press the filter button (right of the search bar). You will
see a filter dialog pop up:

![Screenshot of the network screen]({% asset tools/devtools/network-filter-dialog.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

The filter query syntax is described in the dialog. You can filter network
requests by the following keys:
* `method`, `m`: this filter corresponds to the value in the "Method" column
* `status`, `s`: this filter corresponds to the value in the "Status" column
* `type`, `t`: this filter corresponds to the value in the "Type" column

Any text that is not paired with an available filter key will be queried against
all categories (method, uri, status, type).

Example filter queries:
```
my-endpoint m:get t:json s:200
```
```
https s:404
```

## Other resources

HTTP and HTTPs requests are also surfaced in the [Timeline][timeline] as
asynchronous timeline events. Viewing network activity in the timeline can be
useful if you want to see how HTTP traffic aligns with other events happening
in your app or in the Flutter framework.
