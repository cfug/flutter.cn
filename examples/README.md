# Flutter example apps

To analyze, test and run individual apps, execute the following commands from
the repo root (`$PROJECT` represents the app project path, such as
`examples/layout/lakes/step6`):

1. `flutter create --no-overwrite $PROJECT`
2. `cd $PROJECT`
3. `dart analyze`
4. `flutter test`
5. `flutter run`
