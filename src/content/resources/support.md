Welcome!



欢迎！

There are many different ways to get support
when developing with Flutter.
As Flutter is an open source project,
your options range from filing issues when you
run into bugs in the software,
to connecting with your local community,
to browsing and identifying a list of commercial agencies
and consultants who offer support services.



在使用 Flutter 进行开发时，有很多不同的方式可以获得支持。
由于 Flutter 是一个开源项目，
你的选择范围从在遇到软件 bug 时提交 issue，
到与本地社区建立联系，
再到浏览和确定一系列提供支持服务的商业机构和顾问。

## I want to report an issue with Flutter



## 我想报告 Flutter 的问题

Visit how to [create a useful bug report](/resources/bug-reports).
Note that filing bugs is _not_ an efficient way to get tech support.



请访问如何[创建有用的 bug 报告](/resources/bug-reports)。
请注意，提交 bug 并 _不是_ 获得技术支持的有效方式。

## I want to ask questions about how to use Flutter



## 我想问关于如何使用 Flutter 的问题

Your best bet is to consult
[Flutter Forum](https://forum.itsallwidgets.com/),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter),
or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rflutterdev).
While the community is active in these channels,
there is no official SLA on responding to new posts
or chats in these channels.



最好的选择是咨询
[Flutter 论坛](https://forum.itsallwidgets.com/)、
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter)
或 [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rflutterdev)。
虽然社区在这些渠道中很活跃，
但这些渠道中的新帖子或聊天没有官方的 SLA 响应时间。

## I want support from a Flutter expert



## 我想要 Flutter 专家的支持

Google has a cadre of [Google Developer Experts][] (GDEs),
non-Google employees with expertise in various areas
of Google technologies, such as Flutter and Dart.
GDEs are _not_ free consultants, but they often give
lectures, host meetups, run workshops, or make videos.
As part of the Dart and Flutter world-wide community,
they are a great resource.



Google 有一批 [Google 开发者专家][Google Developer Experts] (GDE)，
他们是非 Google 员工，在 Google 各种技术领域（如 Flutter 和 Dart）拥有专业知识。
GDE _不是_ 免费顾问，但他们经常进行演讲、主持聚会、举办工作坊或制作视频。
作为 Dart 和 Flutter 全球社区的一部分，他们是很好的资源。
