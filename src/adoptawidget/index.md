{{site.alert.note}}
  The Adopt a Widget program ran during the month of
  November 2020. Thanks so much for your participation!
  We may do something similar in the future.
{{site.alert.end}}

Flutter is an open source project hosted [on GitHub][]
and the API docs (generated from the source code) are
hosted on [api.flutter.dev][].
Adopting a widget and improving its documentation helps everyone!
So, for the month of November, weâ€™re extending a special
invitation to contribute to the Flutter project by choosing
a Widget and improving its API documentation.

[api.flutter.dev]: {{site.api}}

## How to contribute {#how-to-contribute}

1. Go to [this list of issues][] and choose one.
   You can only be assigned one Adopt A Widget issue at a
   time, so choose your favorite!
2. Leave a comment on the issue, asking to be assigned.
   The first person to respond will be assigned. For example:
   <img src="/adoptawidget/images/image2.png" alt="Ask to be assigned" width="100%" />
3. Once you are assigned, set up your environment, make the change,
   and submit the pull request. If you're not sure how to do this,
   see the [Quickstart](#quickstart) guide below.

The [CONTRIBUTING][]
doc has details on contributing to Flutter.

## Guidelines

**Wait to be assigned**

If you aren't assigned to the issue, let the assignee fix it.
Don't submit a pull request for someone else's issue.

**Respond within three days after being assigned**

If we don't hear back from you,
we might need to assign it to someone else.

**One issue at a time**

If you're already working on an issue,
wait until it's closed before requesting another.

**Don't create "Adopt A Widget" issues**

We are limiting AdoptAWidget to [this list of issues][].

**Don't worry if you don't get assigned**

There are plenty of other issues that can be fixed.
You can also take a look for
[issues with the "d: api docs" label][]
that need attention.

[issues with the "d: api docs" label]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22d%3A+api+docs%22

**Be original**

Don't copy code snippets or text from other sources like StackOverflow.

## Ways to contribute {#ways-to-contribute}

Each issue specifies what type of contribution we are looking for:

* Adding code (either a [snippet][], [sample][], or [DartPad][])
* Adding references (for example, under "See also")
* Adding more explanation to the documentation

[DartPad]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets#templates
[sample]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets#sample-tool
[snippet]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets#snippet-tool

### Adding code {#adding-code}

There are three ways to contribute code: a `snippet`,
a `dartpad`, or a `sample`.
For more details, see the [Dartdoc Generation README][].

[Dartdoc Generation README]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets

Please be cognizant that writing _sample_ code has a different goal
(and some additional constraints) compared to writing production code.
Mozilla [has a good overview][] (the article is about the web,
but 95% of it applies to any platform).

[has a good overview]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines#General_best_practices

#### Snippets {#snippets}

Snippets can be added using the following syntax:

```dart
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This is a comment explaining the snippet below:
///
/// ```dart
/// MyWidget(
///   color: Colors.green,
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
```

#### Sample {#sample}

Samples are snippets of code that are wrapped with a template,
so you don't have to write boilerplate code.
The `--template` can be any of the templates found in
the snippet tool's [templates directory][].

```dart
/// {@tool sample --template=stateless_widget_scaffold_center}
///
/// This is a comment explaining the snippet below:
///
/// ```dart
///  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///    return MyWidget(
///      color: Colors.green,
///    );
///  }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
```

[templates directory]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets/config/templates

#### DartPad sample {#dartpad-sample}

To add a sample that runs in DartPad,
use `{@tool dartpad}` and provide the same
templates found in the [templates directory][]:


```dart
/// {@tool dartpad --template=stateless_widget_material}
///
/// This is a comment explaining the snippet below:
///
/// ```dart
///  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///    return MyWidget(
///      color: Colors.green,
///    );
///  }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
```

### Adding References {#adding-references}

If a `Widget` needs references,
add a `See also:` section to the end of a widget's
documentation comment:

```dart
/// Creates a route for the given route settings.
///
/// Used by [Navigator.onGenerateRoute].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Navigator], which is where all the [Route]s end up.
```

### Adding more explanation to the documentation {#adding-more-explanation-to-the-documentation}

If a widget doesn't provide enough explanation,
you can add more! You can explain:

*   What it is
*   What it enables you to do
*   How to use it
*   The behavior of the widget in certain situations
*   Other important information about the widget

See the documentation section of the [Flutter Style Guide][]
and [Effective Dart - Documentation][]
for details on how to write great documentation.

## Quickstart {#quickstart}

Use the following instructions to get started.

### Get the code {#get-the-code}

To get started,
fork the SDK and use `git` to fetch a local copy:

1. Install dependencies listed in
   [Setting up the Framework development environment][].
2. Fork the [Flutter repo][]. For more information,
   see [GitHub's official instructions][].
3. Clone your fork:
   <nobr>`git clone https://github.com/<your_name_here>/flutter.git`</nobr>
4. Change directory into the repo: `cd flutter`
5. Add an upstream remote:
   <nobr>`git remote add upstream git@github.com:flutter/flutter.git`</nobr>
6. Run `flutter update-packages` to fetch all the Dart packages that
   Flutter uses.

[Flutter repo]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter
[GitHub's official instructions]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
[Setting up the Framework development environment]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Framework-development-environment

### Open the code in your IDE {#open-the-code-in-your-ide}

In IntelliJ or VSCode, open `packages/flutter`,
where most of the Flutter framework code lives.

### Make the change {#make-the-change}

Open the file listed in the issue and update the documentation.
See "Ways to contribute" for examples.

### Analyzing and Generating API Docs

Running this command from the root directory analyzes
and generates the documentation. This command can
take up to 20 minutes to complete, so double
check your changes first. If you want, you can also
[analyze snippets][] directly.

```bash
./dev/bots/docs.sh
```

To view the generated docs, open `dev/docs/doc/api/index.html`.

{{site.alert.note}}
  Flutter API docs cannot be generated on Windows.
  If you are using Windows, you may need to download
  the Linux version of the SDK and use the
  [Windows Subsystem for Linux][].
{{site.alert.end}}

For more information, see the [Dartdoc Generation README][].


[analyze snippets]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets#running-sample-analysis-locally
[Dartdoc Generation README]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/tree/master/dev/snippets
[Windows Subsystem for Linux]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about

### Commit the change {#commit-the-change}

Modify the documentation and commit the change:


```bash
git checkout -b update-builder-widget
git add -A
git commit -m "Update Builder API Docs"
git push origin update-builder-widget
```

### Make a pull request {#make-a-pull-request}

Make a pull request with
`AdoptAWidget: WidgetName` in the title,
and fill out this template:

```markdown
AdoptAWidget: Builder

<!-- Provide an explanation of the change -->

<!-- Specify what this pull request does -->
This pull request is:

- [x] A code sample
- [ ] More references
- [ ] More explanation

<!-- Add the AdoptAWidget issue that is assigned to you: -->
closes #1234
