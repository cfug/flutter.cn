Code snippets extracted using [tool/extract.dart](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/master/tool/extract.dart), are saved
into [example.g](example.g). The Yaml files in this folder are copied into
[example.g](example.g), then the snippets are run through the analyzer and
formatter.

Code snippet extraction is deprecated, and will eventually be fully replaced by
use of the code-excerpt tooling. See [#2233][] for details.
