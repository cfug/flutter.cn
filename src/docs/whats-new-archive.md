  to bind your app to native code (a feature currently under
  development).

  and profile a session from your Dart/Flutter application,
  has been enabled in DevTools. For more information,
  see the [Performance view][] page.
* A new page on
  [building a web application][].
* A new page on [creating responsive apps][] in Flutter.
* A new page on [preparing a web app for release][].
* A new [web FAQ][].
* The [Flutter for web][] page is updated.

  For more information, read
  [Improving Flutter's Error Messages][]
  on the [Flutter Medium publication][].
* If you already have a web app that depends on the
  flutter_web package, the following instructions tell
  you how to migrate to the flutter package:
  [Upgrading from package:flutter_web to the Flutter SDK][].
* A new [`ToggleButtons`][] widget, described in the API docs.
  [ToggleButtons demo][]

Flutter released [version 1.2][] at Mobile World Congress
(MWC) in Barcelona. For more information, see the
[1.2.1 release notes][] or [download the release][].

In addition, here are some recent new and updated docs:

* We've updated our [state management advice][].
  New pages include an [introduction][],
  [thinking declaratively][], [ephemeral vs app state][],
  [simple app state management][], and
  [different state management options].
  Documenting state management is a tricky thing, as there is no
  one-size-fits-all approach. We'd love your feedback on these new docs!
* A new page on [Performance best practices][].
* Also at MWC, we announced a preview version of the new Dart DevTools
  for profiling and debugging Dart and Flutter apps.
  You can find the docs on the DevTools wiki
  (Note: since moved to [this site][].)
  In particular, check out the DevTool's [widget inspector][] for
  debugging your UI, or the [timeline view][] for profiling your Flutter
  application. Try them out and let us know what you think!
* An update to the [Performance profiling][]
  page that incorporates the new Dart DevTools UI.
* Updates to the [Android Studio/IntelliJ][]
  and [VS Code][] pages incorporating info from
  the new Dart DevTools UI.

If you have questions or comments about any of these docs,
[file an issue][].
