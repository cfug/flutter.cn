The Flutter News Toolkit enables you to accelerate
development of a mobile news app.
The toolkit assists you in building a customized
template app with prebuilt features required
for most news apps, such authentication and
monetization. After generating your
template app, your primary tasks are to connect to your
data source, and to customize the UI to reflect
your brand.

The Flutter News Toolkit includes critical features,
such as:

* User onboarding
* Account creation/login
* Content feeds and content pages
* Analytics
* Notifications
* Social sharing
* Subscriptions
* Ads

You can use these pre-integrated features out of the box,
or modify and swap them with other functionality that
you prefer.

Generating your template app requires answering
a few simple questions, as described on the
[Flutter News Toolkit Overview][toolkit] doc page.

For complete documentation on how to configure your project,
create a template app, develop the app, how to
handle authentication, theming, work with an API
server, and much more, check out the
[Flutter News Toolkit][toolkit] documentation.
