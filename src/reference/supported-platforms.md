description: The platforms that Flutter supports by platform version.

## Support tiers

We define three tiers of support for the platforms on
which built Flutter might be deployed:

1. **Supported**<br>
   Google-tested platforms that
   are automatically tested on every commit
   by continuous integration testing.
1. **Best effort**<br>
   Platforms that we intend to support through
   coding practices,
   but are only tested on an ad-hoc basis.
1. **Unsupported**<br>
   Platforms that we don't test or support.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
When changing the minimum support version of macOS, Windows, or Linux,
make sure to make a corresponding change in the get started pages:
  * /src/get-started/install/macos.md
  * /src/get-started/install/windows.md
  * /src/get-started/install/linux.md

  A `plus` sign (`+`) in the table indicates "and higher releases".
  A `minus` (`-`) sign directly following a version (with no spaces)
  indicates "and lower releases".
