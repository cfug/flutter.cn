title: Flutter Ecosystem &amp; Plugins Engineer
---

<p>Flutter plugins are the means by which Flutter applications
  communicate with the underlying platform-specific APIs (e.g. GPS,
  camera) or embed platform-specific UI widgets (e.g. WebViews,
  Google Maps).</p>

<p>The Flutter team is looking to improve the quality of our
  ecosystem of Flutter plugins. To that end, we’re seeking software
  engineers to join our team and contribute to this effort.</p>

<p>In the “Ecosystem &amp; Plugins Englineer” role, you’ll be part
  of a team that is tasked with the following  mandates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplify the development of Flutter plugins.</li>
  <li>Make plugin communication between Flutter and the underlying
    platform fast, robust, and simple.</li>
  <li>Maintain and improve the most important reference-implementation
    plugins on Android and iOS — including Google Maps, WebView, Ads,
    and In-App Purchase.</li>
  <li>Encourage the growth and quality of the Flutter plugin ecosystem
    (pub.dev).</li>
  <li>Nurture a thriving community of contributions from open-source
    developers by reviewing GitHub pull requests (PRs).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job responsibilities</h2>

<ol type="A">
  <li> Improve the developer experience or performance of Flutter's
    platform interoperability layer (plugin messaging).

  <li> Work with the Flutter engine team on system-level upgrades,
    such as allowing straight Dart to C++ communication (without going
    through JNI) for low-level library access.
  </li>
  <li> Maintain and improve Flutter platform view integration or
    Flutter's core plugins (Ads, Maps, WebView, In-App Purchase)
    on Android or iOS.
  </li>
  <li> Work directly with Flutter’s high-priority customers to solve
    plugin issues.
