# Defines a tag that renders a code sample with multiple languages.
#
# This custom tag was written by the Flutter team for the Flutter website.
#
# Example Android usage:
#
#   {% samplecode sample-title %}
#   {% sample Java %}
#   <?code-excerpt "MyActivity.java" title?>
#   ```java
#   // Java code here
#   ```
#   {% sample Kotlin %}
#   <?code-excerpt "MyActivity.kt" title?>
#   ```kotlin
#   // Kotlin code here
#   ```
#   {% endsamplecode %}
#
# Example iOS usage:
#
#   {% samplecode sample-title %}
#   {% sample Objective-C %}
#   <?code-excerpt "MyVC.h" title?>
#   ```objectivec
#   // Header file code
#   ```
#   <?code-excerpt "MyVC.c" title?>
#   ```objectivec
#   // Implementation file code
#   ```
#   {% sample Swift %}
#   <?code-excerpt "MyVC.swift" title?>
#   ```swift
#   // Swift code here
#   ```
#   {% endsamplecode %}
#
# The "samplecode" tag accepts a single parameter that represents the title of this sample. The
# title is not displayed on the page, but it is injected into a number of HTML attributes to
# differentiate itself from other code samples. The "samplecode" tag is a block tag and therefore
# must be closed with a "endsamplecode" tag.
#
# The "sample" tag accepts one parameter: the name of the language as it should appear to
# the reader.
#
# Code samples are placed directly beneath their associated "sample" tag.

#
# Understanding custom tags and this class:
#
# There does not seem to be much documentation available for creating custom Liquid tags. The root
# class "Tag" establishes a number of methods that are called at specific times by the templating
# engine. The "Block" class subclasses "Tag" and adds some behavior on top of that protocol.
#
# The fundamental process is:
# 1. The templating engine instructs the Block/Tag to "parse()" a given tag with parameters and content
#    - the 1st parameter, tag_name, is the literal name of the tag
#    - the 2nd parameter, params, is a string that includes all content that appears after the tag name in a tag.
#      The Liquid template engine does not parse multiple parameters for you. You have to do that, yourself.
#    - the 3rd parameter, tokens, is an object that understands all types of content that follows this tag, e.g.,
#      other tags and regular text content. The tokens object is used by the Block class to find and report each
#      inner tag that it finds, so it should probably not be directly manipulated in this class.
#
# 2. The Block superclass looks for other tags within itself while parsing
#    a. If inner tags are found, but not recognized, then the "unknown_tag()" method is invoked.
#    b. This class overrides "unknown_tag()" to find inner "sample" tags.
#    c. For each "sample" tag, fields are set that will be processed when rendering.
#
# 3. The Block/Tag is instructed to "render()". The render step occurs after all parsing is complete. Therefore,
#    it appears that the standard workflow is to collect all needed information during parsing and then apply it
#    during rendering.
#    a. HTML for language tabs are generated for all languages that were found.
#    b. HTML for each code sample is generated, inserting the literal code that was written beneath the given
#       "sample" tag.
#    c. The generated code is returned form the "render()" function.
#
# Reading the source code for Tag, Block, and BlockBody will be helpful in understanding this code. In the
# Liquid project, those classes can be found at:
#
# - lib/liquid/tag.rb
# - lib/liquid/block.rb
# - lib/liquid/block_body.rb
