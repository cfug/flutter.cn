Monetizing apps by using ads has been one of
the most popular requests for many Flutter developers.

Flutter ads support is available through the
[Google Mobile Ads SDK for Flutter (Beta)][plugin],
which works with both AdMob and AdManager.
This plugin supports a variety of ad formats,
including banner (inline and overlay),
interstitial, rewarded video, and native ads.
