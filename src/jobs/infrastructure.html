title: Flutter Infrastructure Engineer
---

<p>The Flutter team is in need of robust infrastructure to facilitate
rapid development. To that end, we’re seeking software engineers
to join our team and contribute to this effort.</p>

<h2>Example projects</h2>

<p>The Flutter team is highly dynamic, and job responsibilities will
change as the project evolves. Some examples of projects that
you may be tasked with are:</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Ensuring that our continuous integration testing
      and performance benchmarking solution is robust, scalable,
      and reliable, by:

    <ol>
      <li>Eliminating sources of 
          <a href="https://hackernoon.com/flaky-tests-a-war-that-never-ends-9aa32fdef359">test flakiness</a>
          in Flutter’s automated tests. This may require
          some combination of the following:

         <ul>
           <li>Refactoring large swaths of Flutter source code
               to make the code more test-friendly.
           </li>
           <li>Creating a means by which we can easily
               identify commits that introduce test flakiness.
           </li>
           <li>Modifying our test environments to be as
               hermetic as possible, thus minimizing the effect that
               environment setup has on test flakiness.
           </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
    </li>
    <li> Scaling our infrastructure to handle a higher
       throughput of commits without getting backlogged.
       This may require some combination of the following:

       <ul>
         <li>Smarter scheduling of which tests to run
             in what order.
         </li>
         <li>Improved dependency analysis to know which
             tests may be safely skipped for a given commit
             depending on what code was modified.
         </li>
         <li>Avoid testing at every commit to save machine
             resources, automatically bisecting commits as
             necessary when a test fails.
         </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Integrating with existing testing solutions
       (e.g. Firebase test lab or Skia performance lab)
       where it makes sense.
    </li>
  </ol>
<li>Growing our test matrix to include new target platforms,
   such as running Flutter on:
   
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/">Fuchsia</a> devices</li>
    <li>Desktop devices (Linux, Windows, Mac)</li>
    <li>The Web (inside a browser)</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Building automated alerting for things like build breakages,
   performance regressions, and critical bugs
</li>
<li>Building automation for streamlining the submission of our
   community contributed code. This includes:
  <ol>
    <li>Bots that can perform static analysis on submitted code
        and submit automatic review comments.
    </li>
    <li>Bots that ensure that code submissions adequately describe
        themselves (for later inclusion in release notes).
    </li>
    <li>Bots that ensure that code submissions have a modicum of tests.
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
