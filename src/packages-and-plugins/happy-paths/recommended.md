## Ads ![Ads happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_Ad_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}  

Are you looking to monetize your mobile app?
You can do that by adding in-app ads using the
`google_mobile_ads` package. You’ll need to register a free 
account with [AdMob][] and you can then leverage
one or more AdMob features, including the following:  

* Several ad formats: Banner, full-screen, native, and rewarded.
* Control over when ads display. For example,
  in between levels of a game, after completing a task,
  or before starting a new game 
* Monetization reports to help you make decisions about your app.

## Background processing ![Background processing happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_Processing_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}

The background processing path shows you how to
run a Dart function in the background on mobile devices.
With background processing, 
you can perform tasks like making an HTTP request,
running an expensive calculation,
or displaying a notification in another isolate
(similar to a lightweight thread).  

There are a of couple ways to incorporate background processing 
into your mobile app. One way is through a [Dart isolate][]. 
With a Dart isolate, you can create a separate thread to 
run tasks concurrently in the background. 

Another way to incorporate background processing is through the 
[WorkManager][] plugin. 
With this plugin, you can enable [persistent][] headless execution of Dart code.
Your tasks remain scheduled through app restarts and system reboots.

  **Is there a difference between a package and a plugin?**
  Yes, there is! Both are packages,
  but a plugin is a type of package that contains 
  platform-specific code (such as Kotlin, Java, Swift, Objective C)
  that communicates with the underlying platform.
  For more information, see [Using packages][].
{{site.alert.end}}  
  
Some features of WorkManager include:

* Persistent work handling 
* Flexible scheduling
* Ability to apply constraints on jobs like checking for a network connection, 
  only running when the device is charging, or only running when a device is 
  idle (Android only)

## Geolocation ![Geolocation happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_Geolocation_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}

Geolocation, the ability to determine where in
the world a user is located, is critical functionality
for many applications; for example, shopping apps need 
to calculate shipping, fitness apps need to track
distance traveled, and so on. 
The plugins in Flutter's ecosystem offer a number
of features to help build these experiences.  

A plugin that provides this functionality is the 
[`geolocator`][] plugin, rated as a [Flutter favorite][]. 
With this plugin, you can check and request permission,
fetch a one-time location, and even provide a stream
of constantly updated values as a user moves about.  

Features include:

* Ability to get a device's current location
* Receive location updates
* Ability to determine whether a devices's
  location services are enabled

## Immutable data  ![Immutable data happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_ImmutableData_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}

For an easy way to represent immutable application data, 
check out two plugins that provide ways to handle and manipulate 
immutable data: [`freezed`][] and [`json_serializable`][],
both rated as [Flutter favorites][]. 

These plugins can be used independently, 
but are also great when used together. 
The `freezed` package handles in-memory objects 
and `json_serializable` maps those immutable 
objects to and from the JSON format.

## Structured local storage ![Structured local storage happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_Storage_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}

Structured local storage increases app performance and
improves the user experience by selectively saving expensive
or slow data on a user’s device. 
This path suggests two plugins for local persistence:
`drift` and `hive`. 
Which plugin you choose depends on your needs.  

Drift, rated a [Flutter favorite][],
offers a fully-typed object relational mapping (ORM)
around SQLite, with support on all Flutter platforms.
Developers who require a fully relational database on
their users' device will benefit most from this package.

Hive offers a fully-typed object document mapping (ODM)
around a custom storage solution, with support on all
Flutter platforms. Developers who do not require a fully
relational database, especially if they use document-based
storage on their server (like Cloud Firestore)
will benefit most from this package.

## Web sockets ![Web Sockets Happy path image](/assets/images/docs/happy-paths/HappyPaths_Icon_WebSockets_3d_001.png){:width="20%"}

Web sockets enable communication between Flutter clients and servers. 
This path suggests two packages to use when installing
and using web sockets.

Use the [`web_socket_channel`][] package for client-side
web socket connections,
and the [`web_socket_connections`][] package 
for server-side Dart web sockets.
