## What is it?

Allocated Dart objects created using a class constructor
(for example, by using `new MyClass()` or `MyClass()`)
live in a portion of memory called the heap.

DevTools Memory pane lets you peek at how an isolate is using
memory at a given moment. This pane, using Snapshot and
Reset, can display accumulator counts. The accumulators
can be used to study the rate of memory allocations,
if you suspect your application is leaking memory or has
other bugs relating to memory allocation.

Memory profiling consists of four parts, each increasing
in granularity:

* Memory overview chart
* Event timeline
* Snapshot classes
* Class instances

{{site.alert.note}}
  **Use [profile mode][] when running your app to analyze performance.**
  Memory usage is not indicative of release performance unless your
  application is run in profile mode. In general, memory usage is
  fairly accurate, in relative terms, between debug, release, or
  profile modes. Profile mode might show higher absolute memory usage
  because a service isolate is created to profile your application.
  This isolate won't exist in release mode. Absolute memory used might
  also be higher in debug versus release mode. In release mode,
  work can be computed and optimized ahead of time, while in debug
  mode that same work might have to be computed at runtime,
  requiring more information.

## Memory anatomy

Use a timeseries graph to visualize the state of the Flutter memory
at successive intervals of time. Each data point on the chart
corresponds to the timestamp (x-axis) of measured quantities (y-axis)
of the heap, for example, usage, capacity, external, garbage
collection, and resident set size.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Legend**</dt>
<dd>All collected measurements regarding the memory.
    Clicking a legend name hides or shows that data.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Range selector**</dt>
<dd>All memory data collected (timeseries).
    The left-most or first time/data (memory information),
    in the selector is when the application was launched.
    The right-most or last time/data is the continual memory
    information being received (live) until the application is
    stopped.</dd>

## Memory overview chart

![Screenshot of the basic memory chart]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_basic_chart.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This chart is a timeseries graph to help visualize the state of the
heap at various points in time.

The chart's x-axis is a timeline of events (timeseries).
In other words, it shows the polled state of the memory
every 500 ms. This helps give a live appearance on the
state of the memory as the application is running.
The quantities plotted on the y-axis are (from top to bottom):

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Capacity**</dt>
<dd>Current capacity of the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**GC**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">GC (garbage collection) has occurred.
    For more information on how Dart performs garbage
    collection, see [Don't Fear the Garbage Collector][].
<dt markdown="1">**Used**</dt>
<dd>Objects (Dart objects) in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**External**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Memory that is not in the Dart heap but is still part
  of the total memory footprint. Objects in external memory would be
  native objects (for example, from a memory read from a file,
  or a decoded image). The native objects are exposed to the Dart
  VM from the native OS (such as Android, Linux, Windows, iOS)
  using a Dart embedder. The embedder creates a Dart wrapper with
  a finalizer, allowing Dart code to communicate with these native
  resources. Flutter has an embedder for Android and iOS.
  For more information, see [Dart on the Server][server] or
  [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders][embedder].

![Screenshot of the resident set size table]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_rss_chart.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

To view RSS (resident set size), click the name of the RSS located
in the legend.

* The resident set size displays the amount of memory to a process.
  It doesn't include memory that is swapped out. It includes memory
  from shared libraries that are loaded, as well as all stack and
  heap memory.

For more information, see [Dart VM internals][vm].

## Event timeline

![Screenshot of DevTools events]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_snapshot_reset.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This chart displays DevTools events (such as Snapshot and Reset button
clicks) in relation to the memory chart timeline. Hovering over the
markers in the Event timeline displays the time when the event occurred.
This helps identify when a memory leak might have occurred in the
timeline (x-axis).

![Screenshot of the event timeline]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_eventtimeline.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

Clicking the **Snapshot** button shows the current state of the heap with
regard to all active classes and their instances. When the **Reset** button
is pressed, the accumulator for all classes resets to zero.
The reset is temporally tied, using a faint blue horizontal bar,
to the previous snapshot. Clicking the **Reset** button again resets the
accumulators since the last reset and temporally ties the latest
reset to the previous reset.

## Snapshot classes

![Screenshot of the Snapshot classes]({% asset tools/devtools/memory_classes.png @path %}){:width="100%"}

This pane shows classes allocated in the heap, total instances,
total bytes allocated, and an accumulator of allocations since
the last reset.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Size**</dt>
<dd>Total amount of memory used by current objects
    in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Count**</dt>
<dd>Total number of current objects in the heap.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Accumulator**</dt>
<dd>Total number of objects in the heap since the
    last reset.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Class**</dt>
<dd>An aggregate of the objects allocated to this class.
    Clicking a class name displays a list of class instances.</dd>
</dl>

## Class instances

Displays a list of class instances by their handle name.
[PENDING: add a link to inspecting data values.]

## Memory actions

### Liveness of the memory overview chart

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Pause**</dt>
<dd>Pause the memory overview chart to allow inspecting
    the currently plotted data. Incoming memory data is still received;
    notice the Range selector continues to grow to the right.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Resume**</dt>
<dd>The memory overview chart is live and displaying the
    current time and the latest memory data received.</dd>
</dl>

### Managing the objects and statistics in the heap

<dl markdown="1">

## Glossary of VM terms

Here are some computer science concepts that will help you better
understand how your application uses memory.

<dl markdown="1">
<dt markdown="1">**Garbage collection (GC)**</dt>
<dd>GC is the process of searching the
    heap to locate, and reclaim, regions of "dead" memory&mdash;memory
    that is no longer being used by an application. This process
    allows the memory to be re-used and minimizes the risk of an
    application running out of memory, causing it to crash. Garbage
    collection is performed automatically by the Dart VM. In DevTools,
    you can perform garbage collection on demand by clicking the
    GC button.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Heap**</dt>
<dd>Dart objects that are dynamically allocated live in a portion of
    memory called the heap. An object allocated from the heap is freed
    (eligible for garbage collection) when nothing points to it,
    or when the application terminates. When nothing points to an
    object, it is considered to be dead. When an object is pointed
    to by another object, it is live.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Isolates**</dt>
<dd markdown="1">Dart supports concurrent execution by way of isolates,
    which you can think of processes without the overhead.
    Each isolate has its own memory and code that can't be
    affected by any other isolate. For more information,
    see [The Event Loop and Dart][event-loop].
<dt markdown="1">**Memory leak**</dt>
<dd>A memory leak occurs when an object is live
    (meaning that another object points to it), but it is not being
    used (so it shouldn't have any references from other objects).
    Such an object can't be garbage collected, so it takes up space
    in the heap and contributes to memory fragmentation.
    Memory leaks put unnecessary pressure on the VM and can be
    difficult to debug.</dd>
<dt markdown="1">**Virtual machine (VM)**</dt>
<dd>The Dart virtual machine is a piece of
    software that directly executes Dart code.</dd>
